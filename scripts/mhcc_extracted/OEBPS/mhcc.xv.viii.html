  <p id="xv.viii-p7">This history has been considered, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.viii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iKgs.10.html">1Ki 10</a>; yet because our Saviour has proposed it as an example in seeking after him, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.viii-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.12.html#Matt.12.42">Mt 12:42</a>, we must not pass it over without observing, that those who know the worth of true wisdom will grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Sheba put herself to a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and yet, learning from him to serve God, and do
	 her duty, she thought herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is that pearl of great price, for which, if we part with all, we make a good bargain.</p>

  <p id="xv.viii-p8">The imports here mentioned, would show that prosperity drew the minds of Solomon and his subjects to the love of things curious and uncommon, though useless in themselves. True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which
	 could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth
	 and power to one who he knew would be a fool! <a class="scripRef" id="xv.viii-p8.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eccl.2.html#Eccl.2.18">Ec 2:18</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.viii-p8.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eccl.2.html#Eccl.2.19">19</a>. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
