      <p id="xxvii.xxvii-p1">  The merchandise of Tyre. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxvii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.27.html#Ezek.27.1">Ezek. 27:1-25</a>) Its fall and ruin. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxvii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.27.html#Ezek.27.26">Ezek. 27:26-36</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxvii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxvii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.27.html#Ezek.27.1">Ezek. 27:1-25</a></b>  Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxvii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxvii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.27.html#Ezek.27.26">Ezek. 27:26-36</a></b>  The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and states, sooner or later, come down. Those who make creatures their confidence, and rest their hopes upon them, will fall with them: happy are those who have the God of Jacob for their Help, and whose hope is in the Lord their God, who lives for ever. Those who engage in trade should learn to conduct their business according to God's word. Those who possess wealth should remember they are the Lord's stewards, and should use his goods in doing good to all. Let us seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.</p>
