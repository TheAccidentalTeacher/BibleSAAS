      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p1">  God's unchangeable love for his people.

      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xliii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.43.html#Isa.43.1">Is. 43:1-7</a></b>  God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them.  What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xliii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.43.html#Isa.43.8">Is. 43:8-13</a></b>  Idolaters are called to appear in defence of their idols. Those who make them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They have the shape and faculties of men; but they have not common sense. But God's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of his promise. All servants of God can give such an account of what he has wrought in them, and done for them, as may lead others to know and believe his power, truth, and love</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xliii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.43.html#Isa.43.14">Is. 43:14-21</a></b>  The deliverance from Babylon is foretold, but there is reference to greater events. The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p8"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xliii-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xliii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.43.html#Isa.43.22">Is. 43:22-28</a></b>  Those who neglect to call upon God, are weary of him. The Master tired not the servants with his commands, but they tired him with disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I, even I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encourages us to repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows the freeness of Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not for any thing in us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake; especially for his Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour. Would man justify himself before God? The attempt is desperate: our first father broke the covenant, and we all have copied his example. We have no reason to expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ; and that is always attended by true repentance, and followed by newness of life, by hatred of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him in remembrance of the promises he has made to the penitent, and the satisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him in wrestling for pardon; and declare these things, that thou mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it is a sure way to peace.</p>
