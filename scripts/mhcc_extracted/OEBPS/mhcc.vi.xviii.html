  <p id="vi.xviii-p9">Care is taken that the priests entangle not themselves with the affairs of this life, nor enrich themselves with the wealth of this world; they have better things to mind. Care is likewise taken that they want not the comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide for them. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought to give help for the comfortable support of those that minister in such assemblies.</p>

  <p id="vi.xviii-p10">Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions, should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom God had made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after many like cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, &amp;c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause
	 of the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light, as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat their followers.</p>

  <p id="vi.xviii-p11">It is here promised concerning Christ, that there should come a Prophet, great above all the prophets; by whom God would make known himself and his will to the children of men, more fully and clearly than he had ever done before. He is the Light of the world, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xviii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.8.html#John.8.12">Joh 8:12</a>. He is the World by whom God speaks to us, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xviii-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.1.html#John.1.1">Joh 1:1</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xviii-p11.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.1.html#Heb.1.2">Heb 1:2</a>. In his birth he should be one of their
	 nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS; and is “He that should come,” and we are to look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever
	 refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xviii-p11.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.12.html#John.12.48">Joh 12:48</a>. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets. It
	 highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is not that which the Lord has spoken.</p>
