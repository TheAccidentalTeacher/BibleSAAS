      <h2 id="xxix.iv-p0.2">Chapter 4</h2>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p1">  God's judgments against the sins of the people. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.1">Hos. 4:1-5</a>) and of the priests. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.6">Hos. 4:6-11</a>) Idolatry is reproved, and Judah is admonished. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.12">Hos. 4:12-19</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.1">Hos. 4:1-5</a></b>  Hosea reproves for immorality, as well as idolatry. There was no truth, mercy, or knowledge of God in the land: it was full of murders, <a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iiKgs.21.html#iiKgs.21.16">II Kin. 21:16</a>. Therefore calamities were near, which would desolate the country. Our sins, as separate persons, as a family, as a neighbourhood, as a nation, cause the Lord to have a controversy with us; let us submit and humble ourselves before Him, that he may not go on to destroy.</p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.6">Hos. 4:6-11</a></b>  Both priests and people rejected knowledge; God will justly reject them. They forgot the law of God, neither desired nor endeavoured to retain it in mind, and to transmit the remembrance to their posterity; therefore God will justly forget them and their children. If we dishonour God with that which is our honour, it will, sooner or later, be turned into shame to us. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the consideration of the sacrifices, which showed what an offence sin was to God, since it needed an atonement, the priests encouraged the people to sin, since atonement might be made at so small an expense. It is very wicked to be pleased with the sins of others, because they may turn to our advantage. What is unlawfully gained, cannot be comfortably used. The people and the priests hardened one another in sin; therefore justly shall they share in the punishment. Sharers in sin must expect to share in ruin. Any lust harboured in the heart, in time will eat out all its strength and vigour. That is the reason why many professors grow so heavy, so dull, so dead in the way of religion. They have a liking for some secret lust, which takes away their hearts.</p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.iv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.iv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.4.html#Hos.4.12">Hos. 4:12-19</a></b>  The people consulted images, and not the Divine word. This would lead to disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges for themselves, and vice is spread through a people. Let not Judah come near the idolatrous worship of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin. Those who are not disturbed in their sin, will be destroyed for their sin. May we be kept from this awful state; for the wrath of God, like a strong tempest, will soon hurry impenitent sinners into ruin.</p>
