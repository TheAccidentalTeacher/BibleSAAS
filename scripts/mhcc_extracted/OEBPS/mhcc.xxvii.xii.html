      <p id="xxvii.xii-p1">  The approaching captivity. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.1">Ezek. 12:1-16</a>) An emblem of the consternation of the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.17">Ezek. 12:17-20</a>) Answers to the objections of scoffers. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.21">Ezek. 12:21-28</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.1">Ezek. 12:1-16</a></b>  By the preparation for removal, and his breaking through the wall of his house at evening, as one desirous to escape from the enemy, the prophet signified the conduct and fate of Zedekiah. When God has delivered us, we must glorify him and edify others, by acknowledging our sins. Those who by afflictions are brought to this, are made to know that God is the Lord, and may help to bring others to know him.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.17">Ezek. 12:17-20</a></b>  The prophet must eat and drink in care and fear, with trembling, that he might express the condition of those in Jerusalem during the siege. When ministers speak of the ruin coming upon sinners, they must speak as those that know the terrors of the Lord. Afflictions are happy ones, however grievous to flesh and blood, that improve us in the knowledge of God.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.21">Ezek. 12:21-28</a></b>  From that forbearance of God, which should have led them to repent, the Jews hardened themselves in sin. It will not serve for an excuse in speaking evil, to plead that it is a common saying. There is but a step between us and an awful eternity; therefore it concerns us to get ready for a future state. No one will be able to put from himself the evil day, unless by seeking peace with the Lord.</p>
