  <h3 class="s02" id="x.xx-p10.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="x.xx-p10.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iSam.20.html#iSam.20.1">1–10</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="x.xx-p11">The trials David met with, prepared him for future advancement. Thus the Lord deals with those whom he prepares unto glory. He does not put them into immediate possession of the kingdom, but leads them to it through much tribulation, which he makes the means of fitting them for it. Let them not murmur at his gracious appointment, nor distrust his care; but let them look forward with joyful expectation to the crown which is laid up for them. Sometimes it appears to us that there is
	 but a step between us and death; at all times it may be so, and we should prepare for the event. But though dangers appear most threatening, we cannot die till the purpose of God concerning us is accomplished; nor till we have served our generation according to his will, if we are believers. Jonathan generously offers David his services. This is true friendship. Thus Christ testifies his love to us, Ask, and it shall be done for you; and we must testify our love to him, by keeping his
	 commandments.</p>

  <p id="x.xx-p12">Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the
	 force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!</p>

      <a id="x.xx-p12.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Sam.20.24-1Sam.20.34"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="x.xx-p12.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="x.xx-p12.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iSam.20.html#iSam.20.24">24–34</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="x.xx-p13">None were more constant than David in attending holy duties; nor had he been absent, but self-preservation obliged him to withdraw. In great peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to
	 our advantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was outrageous. What savage beasts, and worse, does anger make men!</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Sam.20.35-1Sam.20.42">

  <p id="x.xx-p14">The separation of two such faithful friends was grievous to both, but David's case was the more deplorable, for David was leaving all his comforts, even those of God's sanctuary. Christians need not sorrow, as men without hope; but being one with Christ, they are one with each other, and will meet in his presence ere long, to part no more; to meet where all tears shall be wiped from their eyes.</p>
