  <p id="xix.xxii-p11">Eliphaz considers that, because Job complained so much of his afflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but Job was far from thinking so. What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly wise,
	 just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud claim of the self-confident.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.22.5-Job.22.14"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxii-p11.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxii-p11.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.22.html#Job.22.5">5–14</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxii-p12">Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for his accusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God always visited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that he did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xix.xxii-p12.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.22.15-Job.22.20"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxii-p12.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxii-p12.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.22.html#Job.22.15">15–20</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxii-p13">Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden, and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it, that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xix.xxii-p13.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.22.21-Job.22.30"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxii-p13.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxii-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.22.html#Job.22.21">21–30</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxii-p14">The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether
	 there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.</p>
