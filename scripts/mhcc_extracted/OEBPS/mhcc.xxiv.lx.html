      <h2 id="xxiv.lx-p0.2">Chapter 60</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p1">  The glories of the church of God, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.1">Is. 60:1-8</a>) and the Jews shall be converted and gathered from their dispersions. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.9">Is. 60:9-14</a>) and the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.15">Is. 60:15-22</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.1">Is. 60:1-8</a></b>  As far as we have the knowledge of God in us, and the favour of God towards us, our light is come. And if God's glory is seen upon us to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives, to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jews which can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; we must conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts the purity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is here described. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word and ordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge and shelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poor souls hastening to Christ!</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.9">Is. 60:9-14</a></b>  God will be very gracious. We must begin with his promise, thence all mercies take rise. Many shall be brought into the church, even from far countries. Christ is always ready to receive all who come to him; and the gate of mercy is always open, night and day. All that are about the church shall be made serviceable to it. But those who will not be subject to Christ's golden sceptre, to his word and Spirit, who will not be kept in by the laws and rules of his family, shall be broken in pieces by his iron rod. The peculiar advantages of every nation, and of every description of men, shall join to beautify the church of Christ. We must suppose this to be accomplished in the beauties of holiness, and the graces and comforts of the Spirit, with which gospel ordinances are adorned and enriched. Blessed be his name, the gates of Zion are ever open to returning sinners.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lx-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.15">Is. 60:15-22</a></b>  We must look for the full accomplishment in times and things, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations and their kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such a salvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, as discovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall be changed for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats of those that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence. Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written upon with praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images and expressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lx-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.21.html#Rev.21.23">Rev. 21:23</a>; 22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of the church on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Those that make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficient light. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people on earth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. They shall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be made perfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When it shall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem too difficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power has undertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord will hasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the time prescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties, and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entrance into this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
