      <h2 id="xxiv.xlviii-p0.2">Chapter 48</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p1">  The Jews reproved for their idolatry. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.1">Is. 48:1-8</a>) Yet deliverance is promised them. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.9">Is. 48:9-15</a>) Solemn warnings of judgment upon those who persisted in evil. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.16">Is. 48:16-22</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.1">Is. 48:1-8</a></b>  The Jews valued themselves on descent from Jacob, and used the name of Jehovah as their God. They prided themselves respecting Jerusalem and the temple, yet there was no holiness in their lives. If we are not sincere in religion, we do but take the name of the Lord in vain. By prophecy they were shown how God would deal with them, long before it came to pass. God has said and done enough to prevent men's boasting of themselves, which makes the sin and ruin of the proud worse; sooner or later every mouth shall be stopped, and all become silent before Him. We are all born children of disobedience. Where original sin is, actual sin will follow. Does not the conscience of every man witness to the truth of Scripture? May the Lord prove us, and render us doers of the word.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.9">Is. 48:9-15</a></b>  We have nothing ourselves to plead with God, why he should have mercy upon us. It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy, to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was to refine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver. If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, might justly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many have been brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of grace begun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God's people, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverance for them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss for instruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for his own sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlviii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlviii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.48.html#Isa.48.16">Is. 48:16-22</a></b>  The Holy Spirit qualifies for service; and those may speak boldly, whom God and his Spirit send. This is to be applied to Christ. He was sent, and he had the Spirit without measure. Whom God redeems, he teaches; he teaches to profit by affliction, and then makes them partakers of his holiness. Also, by his grace he leads them in the way of duty; and by his providence he leads in the way of deliverance. God did not afflict them willingly. If their sins had not turned them away, their peace should have been always flowing and abundant. Spiritual enjoyments are ever joined with holiness of life and regard to God's will. It will make the misery of the disobedient the more painful, to think how happy they might have been. And here is assurance given of salvation out of captivity. Those whom God designs to bring home to himself, he will take care of, that they want not for their journey. This is applicable to the grace laid up for us in Jesus Christ, from whom all good flows to us, as the water to Israel out of the rock, for that Rock was Christ. The spiritual blessings of redemption, and the rescue of the church from antichristian tyranny, are here pointed to. But whatever changes take place, the Lord warned impenitent sinners that no good would come to them; that inward anguish and outward trouble, which spring from guilt and from the Divine wrath, must be their portion for ever.</p>
