  <p id="ii.xxix-p11">Jacob proceeded cheerfully in his journey, after the sweet communion he had with God at Beth-el. Providence brought him to the field where his uncle's flocks were to be watered. What is said of the care of the shepherds for their sheep, may remind us of the tender concern which our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, has for his flock the church; for he is the good Shepherd, that knows his sheep, and is known of them. The stone at the well's mouth was to secure it; water was
	 scarce, it was not there for every one's use: but separate interests should not take us from helping one another. When all the shepherds came together with their flocks, then, like loving neighbours, they watered their flocks together. The law of kindness in the tongue has a commanding power, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.31.html#Prov.31.26">Pr 31:26</a>. Jacob was civil to these strangers, and he found them civil to him.</p>

  <p id="ii.xxix-p12">See Rachel's humility and industry. Nobody needs to be ashamed of honest, useful labour, nor ought it to hinder any one's preferment. When Jacob understood that this was his kinswoman, he was very ready to serve her. Laban, though not the best humoured, bade him welcome, and was satisfied with the account Jacob gave of himself. While we avoid being foolishly ready to believe every thing which is told us, we must take heed of being uncharitably suspicious.

  <p id="ii.xxix-p13">During the month that Jacob spent as a guest, he was not idle. Wherever we are, it is good to employ ourselves in some useful business. Laban was desirous that Jacob should continue with him. Inferior relations must not be imposed upon; it is our duty to reward them. Jacob made known to Laban the affection he had for his daughter Rachel. And having no wordly goods with which to endow her, he promises seven years' service Love makes long and hard services short and easy; hence we read
	 of the labour of love, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p13.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.6.html#Heb.6.10">Heb 6:10</a>. If we know how to value the happiness of heaven, the sufferings of this present time will be as nothing to us. An age of work will be but as a few days to those that love God, and long for Christ's appearing. Jacob, who had imposed upon his father, is imposed upon by Laban, his father-in-law, by a like deception. Herein, how unrighteous soever Laban was, the Lord was righteous: see <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p13.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Judg.1.html#Judg.1.7">Jud
	 1:7</a>. Even the righteous, if they take a false step, are sometimes thus recompensed in the earth. And many who are not, like Jacob, in their marriage, disappointed in person, soon find themselves, as much to their grief, disappointed in the character. The choice of that relation ought to be made with good advice and thought on both sides. There is reason to believe that Laban's excuse was not true. His way of settling the matter made bad worse. Jacob was drawn into the disquiet of
	 multiplying wives. He could not refuse Rachel, for he had espoused her; still less could he refuse Leah. As yet there was no express command against marrying more than one wife. It was in the patriarchs a sin of ignorance; but it will not justify the like practice now, when God's will is plainly made known by the Divine law, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lev.18.html#Lev.18.18">Le 18:18</a>, and more fully since, by our Saviour, that one man and woman only must be joined together, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p13.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.7.html#iCor.7.2">1Co
	 7:2</a>.</p>

  <p id="ii.xxix-p14">The names Leah gave her children, expressed her respect and regard, both to God and to her husband. Reuben, or See a son, with this thought, Now will my husband love me; Levi, or joined, expecting, Now will my husband be joined unto me. Mutual affection is both the duty and comfort of the married relation; and yoke-fellows should study to recommend themselves to each other, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p14.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.7.html#iCor.7.33">1Co 7:33</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxix-p14.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.7.html#iCor.7.34">34</a>. She thankfully
	 acknowledges the kind providence of God in hearing her. Whatever supports and comforts us under afflictions, or tends to our deliverance from them, God must be owned in it. Her fourth son she called Judah, or praise, saying, Now will I praise the Lord. This was he, of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favours should quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praise the Lord more and
	 better than I have done. All our praises must centre in Christ, both as the matter of them, and as the Mediator of them. He descended after the flesh from him whose name was “Praise,” and He is our praise. Is Christ formed in my heart? Now will I praise the Lord.</p>
