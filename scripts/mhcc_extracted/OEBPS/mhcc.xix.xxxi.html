  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxxi-p12.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p12.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.31.html#Job.31.1">1–8</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxxi-p13">Job did not speak the things here recorded by way of boasting, but in answer to the charge of hypocrisy. He understood the spiritual nature of God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases we owe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest our innocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on which
	 multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoided all sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be used with comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without strict honestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no good
	 evidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abide this touchstone!</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.31.9-Job.31.15"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxxi-p13.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.31.html#Job.31.9">9–15</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxxi-p14">All the defilements of the life come from a deceived heart. Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ, will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; it consumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job had a numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he had
	 a Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe with us, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.31.16-Job.31.23"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxxi-p14.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p14.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.31.html#Job.31.16">16–23</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxxi-p15">Job's conscience gave testimony concerning his just and charitable behaviour toward the poor. He is most large upon this head, because in this matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, and hurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained from being uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, as certainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldly interests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of God
	 alone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.</p>

  <p id="xix.xxxi-p16">Job protests, 1. That he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that they have not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through the determination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or pierce themselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. The source of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokes God to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nor delighted in the hurt
	 of the worst enemy he had. If others bear malice to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He had never been unkind to strangers. Hospitality is a Christian duty, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p16.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iPet.4.html#iPet.4.9">1Pe 4:9</a>.</p>

  <p id="xix.xxxi-p17">Job clears himself from the charge of hypocrisy. We are loth to confess our faults, willing to excuse them, and to lay the blame upon others. But he that thus covers his sins, shall not prosper, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p17.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.28.html#Prov.28.13">Pr 28:13</a>. He speaks of his courage in what is good, as an evidence of his sincerity in it. When men get estates unjustly, they are justly deprived of comfort from them; it was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. What men do not come honestly by,
	 will never do them any good. The words of Job are ended. They end with a bold assertion, that, with respect to accusation against his moral and religious character as the cause for his sufferings, he could appeal to God. But, however confident Job was, we shall see he was mistaken, chap. <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p17.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.40.html#Job.40.4">40:4</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p17.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.40.html#Job.40.5">5</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxi-p17.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iJohn.1.html#iJohn.1.8">1Jo 1:8</a>. Let us all judge ourselves; wherein we are guilty, let us seek
	 forgiveness in that blood which cleanseth from all sin; and may the Lord have mercy upon us, and write his laws in our hearts!</p>
