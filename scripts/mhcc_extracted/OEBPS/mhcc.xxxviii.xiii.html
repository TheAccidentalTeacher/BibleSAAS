  <p id="xxxviii.xiii-p9">The excellent way had in view in the close of the former chapter, is not what is meant by charity in our common use of the word, almsgiving, but love in its fullest meaning; true love to God and man. Without this, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of no value without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an open and lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart.
	 Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love to God, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while we withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the most painful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance and reward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as they are corrupt and selfish!</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxviii.xiii-p9.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Cor.13.4-1Cor.13.7"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxviii.xiii-p9.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xiii-p9.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.13.html#iCor.13.4">4–7</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxviii.xiii-p10">Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether we have this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we have it. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone of our professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of the nature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians that their conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its own
	 praise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroys all regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglect himself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare of others to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable is Christian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to the world, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle, and paid due regard to
	 the command on which its blessed Author laid the chief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts. Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are we willing to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call to watchfulness, diligence, and prayer.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxviii.xiii-p10.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Cor.13.8-1Cor.13.13"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxviii.xiii-p10.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xiii-p10.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.13.html#iCor.13.8">8–13</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxviii.xiii-p11">Charity is much to be preferred to the gifts on which the Corinthians prided themselves. From its longer continuance. It is a grace, lasting as eternity. The present state is a state of childhood, the future that of manhood. Such is the difference between earth and heaven. What narrow views, what confused notions of things, have children when compared with grown men! Thus shall we think of our most valued gifts of this world, when we come to heaven. All things are dark and confused
	 now, compared with what they will be hereafter. They can only be seen as by the reflection in a mirror, or in the description of a riddle; but hereafter our knowledge will be free from all obscurity and error. It is the light of heaven only, that will remove all clouds and darkness that hide the face of God from us. To sum up the excellences of charity, it is preferred not only to gifts, but to other graces, to faith and hope. Faith fixes on the Divine revelation, and assents thereto, relying
	 on the Divine Redeemer. Hope fastens on future happiness, and waits for that; but in heaven, faith will be swallowed up in actual sight, and hope in enjoyment. There is no room to believe and hope, when we see and enjoy. But there, love will be made perfect. There we shall perfectly love God. And there we shall perfectly love one another. Blessed state! how much surpassing the best below! God is love, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xiii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iJohn.4.html#iJohn.4.8">1Jo 4:8</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xiii-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iJohn.4.html#iJohn.4.16">16</a>.
	 Where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face, there charity is in its greatest height; there only will it be perfected.</p>
