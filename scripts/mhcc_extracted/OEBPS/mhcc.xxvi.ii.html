      <p id="xxvi.ii-p1">  Lamentation for the misery of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.ii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.ii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.ii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.2.html#Lam.2.1">Lam. 2:1-9</a></b>  A sad representation is here made of the state of God's church, of Jacob and Israel; but the notice seems mostly to refer to the hand of the Lord in their calamities. Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.ii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.ii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.ii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.2.html#Lam.2.10">Lam. 2:10-22</a></b>  Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, <a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.ii-p5.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Deut.28.html#Deut.28.53">Deut. 28:53</a>. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.</p>
