      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p1">  The sins of Jerusalem. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.1">Ezek. 22:1-16</a>) Israel is condemned as dross. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.17">Ezek. 22:17-22</a>) As the corruption is general, so shall be the punishment. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.23">Ezek. 22:23-31</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.1">Ezek. 22:1-16</a></b>  The prophet is to judge the bloody city; the city of bloods. Jerusalem is so called, because of her crimes. The sins which Jerusalem stands charged with, are exceeding sinful. Murder, idolatry, disobedience to parents, oppression and extortion, profanation of the sabbath and holy things, seventh commandment sins, lewdness and adultery. Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness. Sinners provoke God because they forget him. Jerusalem has filled the measure of her sins. Those who give up themselves to be ruled by their lusts, will justly be given up to be portioned by them. Those who resolve to be their own masters, let them expect no other happiness than their own hands can furnish; and a miserable portion it will prove.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.17">Ezek. 22:17-22</a></b>  Israel, compared with other nations, had been as the gold and silver compared with baser metals. But they were now as the refuse that is consumed in the furnace, or thrown away when the silver is refined. Sinners, especially backsliding professors, are, in God's account, useless and fit for nothing. When God brings his own people into the furnace, he sits by them as the refiner by his gold, to see that they are not continued there any longer than is fitting and needful. The dross shall be wholly separated, and the good metal purified. Let those who suffer pains, or lingering sickness, and find that their hearts can scarcely bear these light and momentary afflictions, take warning to flee from the wrath to come; for if these trials are not sanctified by the power of the Holy Spirit, to the cleansing their hearts and hands from sin, far worse things will come upon them.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.22.html#Ezek.22.23">Ezek. 22:23-31</a></b>  All orders and degrees of men had helped to fill the measure of the nation's guilt. The people that had any power abused it, and even the buyers and sellers find some way to oppress one another. It bodes ill to a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, and the spirit of prayer is restrained. Let all who fear God, unite to promote his truth and righteousness; as wicked men of every rank and profession plot together to run them down.</p>
