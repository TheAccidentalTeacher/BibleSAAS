  <p id="xiii.ii-p9">Jehoram took warning by God's judgment, and put away the image of Baal, yet he maintained the worship of the calves. Those do not truly repent or reform, who only part with the sins they lose by, but continue to love the sins that they think to gain by.</p>

  <p id="xiii.ii-p10">The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in. He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.ii-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.19.html#Prov.19.3">Pr 19:3</a>. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive
	 them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.ii-p10.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.84.html#Ps.84.6">Ps 84:6</a>. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace,
	 shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.</p>

  <p id="xiii.ii-p11">It is a blessing to be favoured with the company of those who have power with God, and can prevail by their prayers. A kingdom may be upheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done,
	 as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's sacrificing his son. It is well not to urge the worst of men to extremities; we should rather leave them to the judgment of God.</p>
