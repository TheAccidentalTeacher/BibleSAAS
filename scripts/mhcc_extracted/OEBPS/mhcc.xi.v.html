  <p id="xi.v-p11">David was anointed king a third time. His advances were gradual, that his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.

  <p id="xi.v-p12">The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their own strength, and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh. But the pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come, and claim,
	 and cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol, may he reign there for ever!</p>

  <p id="xi.v-p13">David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, <a class="scripRef" id="xi.v-p13.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.60.html#Isa.60.10">Isa 60:10</a>. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of
	 Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.</p>

  <p id="xi.v-p14">The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, <a class="scripRef" id="xi.v-p14.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.2.html#Ps.2.1">Ps 2:1</a>, &amp;c. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers
	 himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any
	 thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, <a class="scripRef" id="xi.v-p14.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Acts.2.html#Acts.2.2">Ac 2:2</a>.</p>
