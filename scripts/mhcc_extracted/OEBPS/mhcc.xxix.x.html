      <h2 id="xxix.x-p0.2">Chapter 10</h2>
      <p id="xxix.x-p1">  The idolatry of Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.x-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.10.html#Hos.10.1">Hos. 10:1-8</a>) They are exhorted to repentance. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.x-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.10.html#Hos.10.9">Hos. 10:9-15</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxix.x-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.x-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.x-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.10.html#Hos.10.1">Hos. 10:1-8</a></b>  A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel now brought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is the Sovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream of the heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down all before it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity is but a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water. Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they now despise as a Saviour.</p>
      <p id="xxix.x-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.x-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.x-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.10.html#Hos.10.9">Hos. 10:9-15</a></b>  Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!</p>
