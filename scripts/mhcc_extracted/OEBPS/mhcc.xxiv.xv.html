      <p id="xxiv.xv-p1">  The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xv-p3">  This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies. Concerning Moab it is foretold, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.15.html#Isa.15.1">Is. 15:1</a>. That their chief cities should be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made in a very little time. <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xv-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.15.html#Isa.15.2">Is. 15:2</a>. The Moabites would have recourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xv-p3.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.15.html#Isa.15.3">Is. 15:3</a>. There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xv-p3.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.15.html#Isa.15.4">Is. 15:4</a>. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in such distress. In <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xv-p3.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.15.html#Isa.15.6">Is. 15:6-9</a>, the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.</p>
