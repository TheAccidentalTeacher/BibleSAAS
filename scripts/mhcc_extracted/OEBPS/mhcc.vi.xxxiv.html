  <p id="vi.xxxiv-p9">Moses seemed unwilling to leave his work; but that being finished, he manifested no unwillingness to die. God had declared that he should not enter Canaan. But the Lord also promised that Moses should have a view of it, and showed him all that good land. Such a sight believers now have, through grace, of the bliss and glory of their future state. Sometimes God reserves the brightest discoveries of his grace to his people to support their dying moments. Those may leave this world with
	 cheerfulness, who die in the faith of Christ, and in the hope of heaven.</p>

  <p id="vi.xxxiv-p10">Moses obeyed this command of God as willingly as any other, though it seemed harder. In this he resembled our Lord Jesus Christ. But he died in honour, in peace, and in the most easy manner; the Saviour died upon the disgraceful and torturing cross. Moses died very easily; he died “at the mouth of the Lord,” according to the will of God. The servants of the Lord, when they have done all their other work, must die at last, and be willing to go home, whenever their Master sends for
	 them, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xxxiv-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Acts.21.html#Acts.21.13">Ac 21:13</a>. The place of his burial was not known. If the soul be at rest with God, it is of little consequence where the body rests. There was no decay in the strength of his body, nor in the vigour and activity of his mind; his understanding was as clear, and his memory as strong as ever. This was the reward of his services, the effect of his extraordinary meekness. There was solemn mourning for him. Yet how great soever our losses have been, we
	 must not give ourselves up to sorrow. If we hope to go to heaven rejoicing, why should we go to the grave mourning?</p>

  <p id="vi.xxxiv-p11">Moses brought Israel to the borders of Canaan, and then died and left them. This signifies that the law made nothing perfect, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xxxiv-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.7.html#Heb.7.19">Heb 7:19</a> It brings men into a wilderness of conviction, but not into the Canaan of rest and settled peace. That honour was reserved for Joshua, our Lord Jesus, of whom Joshua was a type, (and the name is the same,) to do that for us which the law could not do, <a class="scripRef" id="vi.xxxiv-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rom.8.html#Rom.8.3">Ro 8:3</a>. Through him we
	 enter into the spiritual rest of conscience, and eternal rest in heaven. Moses was greater than any other prophet of the Old Testament. But our Lord Jesus went beyond him, far more than the other prophets came short of him. And see a strong resemblance between the redeemer of the children of Israel and the Redeemer of mankind. Moses was sent by God, to deliver the Israelites form a cruel bondage; he led them out, and conquered their enemies. He became not only their deliverer, but their
	 lawgiver; not only their lawgiver, but their judge; and, finally, leads them to the border of the land of promise. Our blessed Saviour came to rescue us out of the slavery of the devil, and to restore us to liberty and happiness. He came to confirm every moral precept of the first lawgiver; and to write them, not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart. He came to be our Judge also, inasmuch as he hath appointed a day when he will judge all the secrets of men, and reward or
	 punish accordingly. This greatness of Christ above Moses, is a reason why Christians should be obedient and faithful to the holy religion by which they profess to be Christ's followers. God, by his grace, make us all so!</p>
