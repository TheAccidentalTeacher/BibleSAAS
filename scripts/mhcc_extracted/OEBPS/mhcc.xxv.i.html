      <p id="xxv.i-p1">  Jeremiah's call to the prophetic office. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.i-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.1.html#Jer.1.1">Jer. 1:1-10</a>) A vision of an almond-tree and of a seething-pot, Divine protection is promised. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.i-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.1.html#Jer.1.11">Jer. 1:11-19</a>)</p>

He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.</p>

      <p id="xxv.i-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.i-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.1.html#Jer.1.11">Jer. 1:11-19</a></b>  God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.</p>
