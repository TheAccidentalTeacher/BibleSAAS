      <p id="iv.xii-p2">—After the laws concerning clean and unclean food, come the laws concerning clean and unclean persons. Man imparts his depraved nature to his offspring, so that, excepting as the atonement of Christ and the sanctification of the Spirit prevent, the original blessing, “Increase and multiply,” <a class="scripRef" id="iv.xii-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.1.html#Gen.1.28">Ge 1:28</a>, is become to the fallen race a direful curse, and communicates sin and misery. Let those women who have received mercy from God in
	 child-bearing, with all thankfulness own God's goodness to them; and this shall please the Lord better than sacrifices.</p>
