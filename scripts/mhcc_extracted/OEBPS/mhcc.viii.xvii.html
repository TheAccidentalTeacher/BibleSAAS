  <p id="viii.xvii-p7">What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. <a class="scripRef" id="viii.xvii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Judg.20.html#Judg.20.28">Jud 20:28</a>. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but
	 bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</p>

  <p id="viii.xvii-p8">Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.</p>
