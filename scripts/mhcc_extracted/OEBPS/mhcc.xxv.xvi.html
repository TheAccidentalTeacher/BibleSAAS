      <p id="xxv.xvi-p1">  Prohibitions given to the prophet. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.1">Jer. 16:1-9</a>) The justice of God in these judgments. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.10">Jer. 16:10-13</a>) Future restoration of the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.14">Jer. 16:14-21</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.1">Jer. 16:1-9</a></b>  The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.10">Jer. 16:10-13</a></b>  Here seems to be the language of those who quarrel at the word of God, and instead of humbling and condemning themselves, justify themselves, as though God did them wrong. A plain and full answer is given. They were more obstinate in sin than their fathers, walking every one after the devices of his heart. Since they will not hearken, they shall be hurried away into a far country, a land they know not. If they had God's favour, that would make even the land of their captivity pleasant.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xvi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xvi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.16.html#Jer.16.14">Jer. 16:14-21</a></b>  The restoration from the Babylonish captivity would be remembered in place of the deliverance from Egypt; it also typified spiritual redemption, and the future deliverance of the church from antichristian oppression. But none of the sins of sinners can be hidden from God, or shall be overlooked by him. He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. The deliverance out of captivity shall be a figure of the great salvation to be wrought by the Messiah. The nations have often known the power of Jehovah in his wrath; but they shall know him as the strength of his people, and their refuge in time of trouble.</p>
