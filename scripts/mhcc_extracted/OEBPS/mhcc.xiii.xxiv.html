  <p id="xiii.xxiv-p9">Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to
	 brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.xxiv-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.5">Jer 32:5</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.xxiv-p9.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.34.html#Jer.34.3">34:3</a>; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.xxiv-p9.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.12.html#Ezek.12.13">Eze 12:13</a>. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.</p>

  <p id="xiii.xxiv-p10">The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who
	 had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.</p>

  <p id="xiii.xxiv-p11">The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. <a class="scripRef" id="xiii.xxiv-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.40.html">40 to 45</a> Jehoiachin was released out of
	 prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin
	 alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.</p>
