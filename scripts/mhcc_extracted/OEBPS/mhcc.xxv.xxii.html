      <p id="xxv.xxii-p1">  Justice is recommended, and destruction threatened in case of disobedience. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.1">Jer. 22:1-9</a>) The captivity of Jehoiakim, and the end of Jeconiah. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.10">Jer. 22:10-19</a>) The doom of the royal family. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.20">Jer. 22:20-30</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.1">Jer. 22:1-9</a></b>  The king of Judah is spoken to, as sitting upon the throne of David, the man after God's own heart. Let him follow his example, that he may have the benefit of the promises made to him. The way to preserve a government, is to do the duty of it. But sin will be the ruin of the houses of princes, as well as of meaner men. And who can contend with destroyers of God's preparing? God destroys neither persons, cities, nor nations, except for sin; even in this world he often makes it plain for what crimes he sends punishment; and it will be clear at the day of judgement.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.10">Jer. 22:10-19</a></b>  Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.22.html#Jer.22.20">Jer. 22:20-30</a></b>  The Jewish state is described under a threefold character. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.</p>
