      <h2 id="xxiv.xli-p0.2">Chapter 41</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.xli-p1">  God's care of his people. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.1">Is. 41:1-9</a>) they are encouraged not to fear. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.10">Is. 41:10-20</a>) The vanity and folly of idolatry. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.21">Is. 41:21-29</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xli-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xli-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.1">Is. 41:1-9</a></b>  Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make what use of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? The Lord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinners encourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of the living God stir up one another in his service? God's people are the seed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title ever given to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was made like to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy are the servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and to walk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thus been favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but the victory shall be sure.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xli-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xli-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.10">Is. 41:10-20</a></b>  God speaks with tenderness; Fear thou not, for I am with thee: not only within call, but present with thee. Art thou weak? I will strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee in the time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with that right hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards and punishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seek their ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God's time. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised and trampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God's word is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear little in his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. The Lord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will make him fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment in the triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers of Christ, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supply all their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heaven lies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want, and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in the world, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constant supply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace, rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p5.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.7.html#John.7.38">John 7:38,39</a>. When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be a great change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, and fir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor in spirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And God will render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit, that all who behold may consider it.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xli-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xli-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.41.html#Isa.41.21">Is. 41:21-29</a></b>  There needs no more to show the folly of sin, than to bring to notice the reasons given in defence of it. There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this he will make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be only with Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except those of the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lord showed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon. The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hid from ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of nobler name and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May we be numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.</p>
