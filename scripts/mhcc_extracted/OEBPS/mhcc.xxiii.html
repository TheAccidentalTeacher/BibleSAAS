      <h1 id="xxiii-p0.1">Song of Solomon</h1>
      <p id="xxiii-p1">  This book is a Divine allegory, which represents the love between Christ and his church of true believers, under figures taken from the relation and affection that subsist between a bridegroom and his espoused bride; an emblem often employed in Scripture, as describing the nearest, firmest, and most sure relation: see <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.45.html">Ps. 45</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.5">Is. 54:5,6</a>; 62:5; <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.2.html#Jer.2.2">Jer. 2:2</a>; 3:1; also in Ezekiel, Hosea, and by our Lord himself, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.9.html#Matt.9.15">Matt. 9:15</a>; 25:1: see also <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.21.html#Rev.21.2">Rev. 21:2,9</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xxiii-p1.6" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eph.5.html#Eph.5.27">Eph. 5:27</a>. There is no character in the church of Christ, and no situation in which the believer is placed, but what may be traced in this book, as humble inquirers will find, on comparing it with other Scriptures, by the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, in answer to their supplications. Much, however, of the language has been misunderstood by expositors and translators. The difference between the customs and manners of Europe, and those of the East, must especially be kept in view. The little acquaintance with eastern customs possessed by most of our early expositors and translators, has in many cases prevented a correct rendering. Also, the changes in our own language, during the last two or three centuries, affect the manner in which some expressions are viewed, and they must not be judged by modern notions. But the great outlines, rightly interpreted, fully accord with the affections and experience of the sincere Christian.</p>
