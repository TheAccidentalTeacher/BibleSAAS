Those that have a constant hatred to God and his people, as the carnal mind has, can only expect to be made desolate for ever.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxxv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxxv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.35.html#Ezek.35.10">Ezek. 35:10-15</a></b>  When we see the vanity of the world in the disappointments, losses, and crosses, which others meet with, instead of showing ourselves greedy of worldly things, we should sit more loose to them. In the multitude of words, not one is unknown to God; not the most idle word; and the most daring is not above his rebuke. In the destruction of the enemies of the church, God designs his own glory; and we may be sure that he will not come short of his design. And when the fulness of the Jews and Gentiles shall come into the church, all antichristian opposers shall be destroyed.</p>
