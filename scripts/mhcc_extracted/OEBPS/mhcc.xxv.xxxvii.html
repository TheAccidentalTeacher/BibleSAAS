      <h2 id="xxv.xxxvii-p0.2">Chapter 37</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xxxvii-p1">  The Chaldean army will return. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxvii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.37.html#Jer.37.1">Jer. 37:1-10</a>) Jeremiah is imprisoned. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxvii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.37.html#Jer.37.11">Jer. 37:11-21</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxvii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxvii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxvii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.37.html#Jer.37.1">Jer. 37:1-10</a></b>  Numbers witness the fatal effects of other men's sins, yet heedlessly step into their places, and follow the same destructive course. When in distress, we ought to desire the prayers of ministers and Christian friends. And it is common for those to desire to be prayed for, who will not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened by a pause in judgments. But if God help us not, no creature can. Whatever instruments God has determined to use, they shall do the work, though they seem unlikely.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxvii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxvii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxvii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.37.html#Jer.37.11">Jer. 37:11-21</a></b>  There are times when it is the wisdom of good men to retire, to enter into their chambers, and to shut the doors, <a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxvii-p5.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.26.html#Isa.26.20">Is. 26:20</a>. Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
