      <h2 id="xxv.li-p0.2">Chapter 51</h2>
      <p id="xxv.li-p1">  Babylon's doom; God's controversy with her; encouragements from thence to the Israel of God. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.51.html#Jer.51.1">Jer. 51:1-58</a>) The confirming of this. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.51.html#Jer.51.59">Jer. 51:59-64</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.li-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.li-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.51.html#Jer.51.1">Jer. 51:1-58</a></b>  The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, <a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.18.html#Rev.18.9">Rev. 18:9,19</a>. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.</p>
      <p id="xxv.li-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.li-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.51.html#Jer.51.59">Jer. 51:59-64</a></b>  This prophecy is sent to Babylon, to the captives there, by Seraiah, who is to read it to his countrymen in captivity. Let them with faith see the end of these threatening powers, and comfort themselves herewith. When we see what this world is, how glittering its shows, and how flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that it shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown into the river Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thus represented, <a class="scripRef" id="xxv.li-p5.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.18.html#Rev.18.21">Rev. 18:21</a>. Those that sink under the weight of God's wrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every antichrist, will soon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in God's word, and quietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but shall not share, the destruction of the wicked.</p>
