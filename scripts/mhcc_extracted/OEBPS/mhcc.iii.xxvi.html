  <p id="iii.xxvi-p11">God manifested his presence among the Israelites in a tabernacle or tent, because of their condition in the wilderness. God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.34.html#Ps.34.7">Ps 34:7</a>. <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Exod.26.html#Exod.26.7">(Ex 26:7-14)</a></p>

  <p id="iii.xxvi-p12">The curtains of meaner materials, being made both longer and broader, covered the others, and were defended by coverings of skins. The whole represents the person and doctrine of Christ, and the church of true Christians, and all heavenly things, which outwardly are mean, but inwardly, and in the sight of God, are glorious and precious.</p>

  <p id="iii.xxvi-p13">The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placed in rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it
	 was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p13.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eph.2.html#Eph.2.20">Eph 2:20</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p13.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eph.2.html#Eph.2.21">21</a>.</p>

  <p id="iii.xxvi-p14">A vail, or curtain, separated the holy place from the most holy place. It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p14.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.9.html#Heb.9.8">Heb 9:8</a>. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made
	 manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxvi-p14.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.27.html#Matt.27.51">Mt 27:51</a>. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God
	 takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts
	 to God than our characters toward men?</p>
