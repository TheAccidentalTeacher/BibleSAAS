      <h2 id="xxiv.xlvii-p0.2">Chapter 47</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.xlvii-p1">  God's judgments on Babylon. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlvii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.47.html#Isa.47.1">Is. 47:1-6</a>) Carelessness and confidence shall not prevent the evil. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlvii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.47.html#Isa.47.7">Is. 47:7-15</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlvii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlvii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlvii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.47.html#Isa.47.1">Is. 47:1-6</a></b>  Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlvii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlvii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlvii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.47.html#Isa.47.7">Is. 47:7-15</a></b>  Let us beware of acting and speaking as Babylon did; of trusting in tyranny and oppression; of boasting as to our abilities, relying on ourselves, and ascribing success to our own prudence and wisdom; lest we partake of her plagues. Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.</p>
