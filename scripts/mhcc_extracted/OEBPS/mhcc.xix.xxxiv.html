  <p id="xix.xxxiv-p11">Elihu calls upon those present to decide with him upon Job's words. The plainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart is sanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures, can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion, better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spoken as if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansed my hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children,
	 <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxiv-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.73.html#Ps.73.13">Ps 73:13–15</a>, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.</p>

  <p id="xix.xxxiv-p12">Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, but intended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him no wrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this ought to silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commit wrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yet there is a day coming, when God will fully render to every man according to his works. Further, though the believer's final condemnation is
	 done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he has merited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done to him, however he may be tried.</p>

  <p id="xix.xxxiv-p13">Elihu appeals directly to Job himself. Could he suppose that God was like those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, and prove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemn God's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggests divers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that God does,
	 and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose souls dwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those on whom God frowns.</p>

      <a id="xix.xxxiv-p13.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Job.34.31-Job.34.37"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xix.xxxiv-p13.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxiv-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Job.34.html#Job.34.31">31–37</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xix.xxxiv-p14">When we reprove for what is amiss, we must direct to what is good. Job's friends would have had him own himself a wicked man. Let will only oblige him to own that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Let us, in giving reproof, not make a matter worse than it is. Elihu directs Job to humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept the punishment. Also to pray to God to discover his sins to him. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself; particularly, under affliction, he
	 desires to be told wherefore God contends with him. It is not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more. And if we are affectionate children, we shall love to speak with our Father, and to tell him all our mind. Elihu reasons with Job concerning his discontent under affliction. We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would have it; but it is not reasonable to expect this. Elihu asks whether there was not sin and folly in what Job said. God
	 is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxxiv-p14.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.145.html#Ps.145.17">Ps 145:17</a>. The believer saith, Let my Saviour, my wise and loving Lord, choose every thing for me. I am sure that will be wisest, and the best for his glory and my good.</p>
