  <p id="xv.xxiv-p9">Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage we sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should
	 satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The
	 answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_2Chr.25.14-2Chr.25.16">

  <p id="xv.xxiv-p10">To worship the gods of those whom Amaziah had conquered, who could not help their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity. If men would consider how unable all those things are to help them, to which they look whenever they forsake God, they would not be such enemies to themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; but he was bidden not to say a word more. The secure sinner
	 rejoices to have silenced his reprovers and monitors; but what comes of it? Those that are deaf to reproof, are ripening for destruction.</p>

  <p id="xv.xxiv-p11">Never was a proud prince more thoroughly mortified than Amaziah by Joash king of Israel. A man's pride will bring him low, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.xxiv-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.29.html#Prov.29.23">Pr 29:23</a>; it goes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.xxiv-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.25.html#Prov.25.8">Pr 25:8</a>. And what are we when we offer to
	 establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from the Lord.</p>
