  <p id="xx.xliv-p2">Former experiences of God's power and goodness are strong supports to faith, and powerful pleas in prayer under present calamities. The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world,
	 which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.</p>

  <p id="xx.xliv-p3">The believer must have times of temptation, affliction, and discouragement; the church must have seasons of persecution. At such times the people of God will be ready to fear that he has cast them off, and that his name and truth will be dishonoured. But they should look above the instruments of their trouble, to God, well knowing that their worst enemies have no power against them, but what is permitted from above.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Ps.44.17-Ps.44.26"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xx.xliv-p3.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xliv-p3.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.44.html#Ps.44.17">17–26</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xx.xliv-p4">In afflictions, we must not seek relief by any sinful compliance; but should continually meditate on the truth, purity, and knowledge of our heart-searching God. Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render
	 us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. #(<a class="scripRef" id="xx.xliv-p4.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.44.html#Ps.44.25">25</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xliv-p4.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.44.html#Ps.44.26">26</a>). Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of
	 them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</p>
