      <p id="xxx.iii-p1">  God's judgments in the latter days. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.1">Joel 3:1-8</a>) The extent of these judgments. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.9">Joel 3:9-17</a>) The blessings the church shall enjoy. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.18">Joel 3:18-21</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.1">Joel 3:1-8</a></b>  The restoration of the Jews, and the final victory of true religion over all opposers, appear to be here foretold. The contempt and scorn with which the Jews have often been treated as a people, and the little value set upon them, are noticed. None ever hardened his heart against God or his church, and prospered long.</p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.9">Joel 3:9-17</a></b>  Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people. There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.</p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxx.iii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxx.iii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Joel.3.html#Joel.3.18">Joel 3:18-21</a></b>  There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.</p>
