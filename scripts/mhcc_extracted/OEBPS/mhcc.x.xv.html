  <p id="x.xv-p11">The sentence of condemnation against the Amalekites had gone forth long before, <a class="scripRef" id="x.xv-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Exod.17.html#Exod.17.14">Ex 17:14</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="x.xv-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Deut.25.html#Deut.25.19">De 25:19</a>, but they had been spared till they filled up the measure of their sins. We are sure that the righteous Lord does no injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors of the Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing the injuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to
	 clear the righteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, <a class="scripRef" id="x.xv-p11.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.18.html#Rev.18.4">Re 18:4</a>. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul's obedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebellious spirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. That which was now destroyed was
	 sacrificed to the justice of God.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Sam.15.10-1Sam.15.23"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="x.xv-p11.5"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="x.xv-p11.6" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iSam.15.html#iSam.15.10">10–23</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="x.xv-p12">Repentance in God is not a change of mind, as it is in us, but a change of method. The change was in Saul; “He is turned back from following me.” Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the
	 rust of the silver, <a class="scripRef" id="x.xv-p12.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jas.5.html#Jas.5.3">Jas 5:3</a>, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience:
	 “Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord.” Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned
	 upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Sam.15.24-1Sam.15.31">

  <p id="x.xv-p13">There were several signs of hypocrisy in Saul's repentance. 1. He besought Samuel only, and seemed most anxious to stand right in his opinion, and to gain his favour. 2. He excuses his fault, even when confessing it; that is never the way of a true penitent. 3. All his care was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in the people. Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble and cannot effect their purposes; something happens they could not foresee, by which their measures are
	 broken; but with God it is not so. The Strength of Israel will not lie.</p>

  <p id="x.xv-p14">Many think the bitterness of death is past when it is not gone by; they put that evil day far from them, which is very near. Samuel calls Agag to account for his own sins. He followed the example of his ancestors' cruelty, justly therefore is all the righteous blood shed by Amalek required. Saul seems unconcerned at the token of God's displeasure which he lay under, yet Samuel mourns day and night for him. Jerusalem was carnally secure while Christ wept over it. Do we desire to do
	 the whole will of God? Turn to him, not in form and appearance, but with sincerity.</p>
