      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p1">  Judgements on Jerusalem and on its enemies. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.1">Is. 29:1-8</a>) The senselessness and hypocrisy of the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.9">Is. 29:9-16</a>) The conversion of the Gentiles, and future blessings for the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.17">Is. 29:17-24</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.1">Is. 29:1-8</a></b>  Ariel may signify the altar of burnt-offerings. Let Jerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men free from judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peace with him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped round about Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he fought against it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down by humbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies is foretold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus the multitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar and worship, shall fall. Speedily will sinners awake from their soothing dreams in the pains of hell.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.9">Is. 29:9-16</a></b>  The security of sinners in sinful ways, is cause for lamentation and wonder. The learned men, through prejudice, said that the Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want of learning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned or unlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and a teachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will of God. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full of his love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; but there are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend to be speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things. They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbers are only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply with custom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind, and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are very different from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severely blamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve a turn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so those that think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him with folly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxix-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxix-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.29.html#Isa.29.17">Is. 29:17-24</a></b>  The wonderful change here foretold, may refer to the affairs of Judah, though it looks further. When a great harvest of souls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then the wilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church, that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Those who, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have cause greatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to the increase of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall become mean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners at home shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly, and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man an offender for a word. They did all they could to bring those into trouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham out of his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, his true seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godly parents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God's grace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth, come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truth shall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. This should encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and are deceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shall learn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religion produces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humble and devout spirit.</p>
