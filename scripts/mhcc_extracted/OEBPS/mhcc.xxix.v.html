      <p id="xxix.v-p1">  The Divine judgments against Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.v-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.5.html#Hos.5.1">Hos. 5:1-7</a>) Approaching desolations threatened. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.v-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.5.html#Hos.5.8">Hos. 5:8-15</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxix.v-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.v-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.v-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.5.html#Hos.5.1">Hos. 5:1-7</a></b>  The piercing eye of God saw secret liking and disposition to sin, the love the house of Israel had to their sins, and the dominion their sins had over them. Pride makes men obstinate in other sins. And as Judah was treading in the same steps, they would fall with Israel. By dealing treacherously with the Lord, men only deceive themselves. Those that go to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only, and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; nor shall any speed who do not seek the Lord while he may be found. See how much it is our concern to seek God early, now, while it is the accepted time, and the day of salvation.</p>
      <p id="xxix.v-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxix.v-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.v-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.5.html#Hos.5.8">Hos. 5:8-15</a></b>  The destruction of impenitent sinners is not mere talk, to frighten them, it is a sentence which will not be recalled. And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.</p>
