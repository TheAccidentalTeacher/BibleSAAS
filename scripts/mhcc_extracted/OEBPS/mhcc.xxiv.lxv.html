      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p1">  The calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.1">Is. 65:1-7</a>) The Lord would preserve a remnant. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.8">Is. 65:8-10</a>) Judgments upon the wicked. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.11">Is. 65:11-16</a>) The future happy and flourishing state of the church. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.17">Is. 65:17-25</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.1">Is. 65:1-7</a></b>  The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because they were first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtless trifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedy change takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious. The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause they are rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. They grieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, and sacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between clean and unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps this is put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to be gotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christ denounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. The proof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride and self-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secret thoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.8">Is. 65:8-10</a></b>  In the bunch of unripe grapes, at present of no value, the new wine is contained. The Jews have been kept a distinct people, that all may witness the fulfilment of ancient prophecies and promises. God's chosen, the spiritual seed of praying Jacob, shall inherit his mountains of bliss and joy, and be carried safe to them through the vale of tears. All things are for the display of God's glory in the redemption of sinners.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.11">Is. 65:11-16</a></b>  Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of the Jews who believed, and of those who persisted in unbelief, are set against one another. They prepared a table for that troop of deities which the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to that countless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them, which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignity of sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In every age and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, and despise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread of life, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake the Lord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness, and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in the abundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves in him. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the God of truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed. They shall think themselves happy in having him for their God, who made them forget their troubles.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.lxv-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxv-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.65.html#Isa.65.17">Is. 65:17-25</a></b>  In the grace and comfort believers have in and from Christ, we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. The former confusions, sins and miseries of the human race, shall be no more remembered or renewed. The approaching happy state of the church is described under a variety of images. He shall be thought to die in his youth, and for his sins, who only lives to the age of a hundred years. The event alone can determine what is meant; but it is plain that Christianity, if universal, would so do away violence and evil, as greatly to lengthen life. In those happy days, all God's people shall enjoy the fruit of their labours. Nor will children then be the trouble of their parents, or suffer trouble themselves. The evil dispositions of sinners shall be completely moritified; all shall live in harmony. Thus the church on earth shall be full of happiness, like heaven. This prophecy assures the servants of Christ, that the time approaches, wherein they shall be blessed with the undisturbed enjoyment of all that is needful for their happiness. As workers together with God, let us attend his ordinances, and obey his commands.</p>
