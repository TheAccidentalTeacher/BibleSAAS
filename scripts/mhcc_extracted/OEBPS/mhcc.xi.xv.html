  <p id="xi.xv-p13">David allows Absalom's pomp. Those parents know not what they do, who indulge a proud humour in their children: many young people are ruined by pride. And those commonly are most eager for authority who least understand its duties.</p>
  </div>

  <p id="xi.xv-p14">See how willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning their children. But how easy and how wicked is it, for children to take advantage of good parents, and to deceive them with the show of religion! The principal men of Jerusalem joined Absalom's feast upon his sacrifice. Pious persons are glad to see others appear religious, and this gives occasion for deceptions. The policy of wicked men, and the subtlety of Satan, are exerted to draw good persons to countenance base
	 designs.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xi.xv-p14.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_2Sam.15.13-2Sam.15.23">

  <p id="xi.xv-p15">David determined to quit Jerusalem. He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall
	 their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall
	 separate us from his love.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_2Sam.15.24-2Sam.15.30">

  <p id="xi.xv-p16">David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us
	 see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, <a class="scripRef" id="xi.xv-p16.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.51.html#Ps.51.3">Ps 51:3</a>; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, <a class="scripRef" id="xi.xv-p16.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.38.html#Ps.38.4">Ps 38:4</a>.</p>

  <p id="xi.xv-p17">David prays not against Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel. He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience,
	 were perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and in death.</p>
