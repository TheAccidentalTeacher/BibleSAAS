      <h2 id="xxv.iv-p0.2">Chapter 4</h2>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p1">  Exhortations and promises. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.1">Jer. 4:1-2</a>) Judah exhorted to repentance. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.3">Jer. 4:3-4</a>) Judgements denounced. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.5">Jer. 4:5-18</a>) The approaching ruin of Judah. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.19">Jer. 4:19-31</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.1">Jer. 4:1,2</a></b>  The first two verses should be read with the last chapter. Sin must be put away out of the heart, else it is not put away out of God's sight, for the heart is open before him.</p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.3">Jer. 4:3,4</a></b>  An unhumbled heart is like ground untilled. It is ground which may be improved; it is our ground let out to us; but it is fallow; it is over-grown with thorns and weeds, the natural product of the corrupt heart. Let us entreat the Lord to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us; for except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.5">Jer. 4:5-18</a></b>  The fierce conqueror of the neighbouring nations was to make Judah desolate. The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.</p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p8"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.iv-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.iv-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.4.html#Jer.4.19">Jer. 4:19-31</a></b>  The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.</p>
