        <b>The sons of Joseph.</b>

      <p id="vii.xvi-p2">—This and the following chapter should not be separated. They give the lots of Ephraim and Manasseh, the children of Joseph, who, next to Judah, were to have the post of honour, and therefore had the first and best portion in the northern part of Canaan, as Judah in the southern part. God's people now, as of old, suffer his enemies to remain. Blessed Lord, when will all our enemies be subdued? <a class="scripRef" id="vii.xvi-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.15.html#iCor.15.26">1Co 15:26</a>. Do thou drive them all out; thou
	 alone canst do it. These settled boundaries may remind us, that our situation and provision in this life, as well as our future inheritance, are appointed by the only wise and righteous God, and we should be content with our portion, since he knows what is best for us, and all we have is more than we deserve.</p>
