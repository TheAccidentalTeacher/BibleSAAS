  <p id="x.xxviii-p9">David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his
	 distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, <a class="scripRef" id="x.xxviii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Exod.22.html#Exod.22.18">Ex 22:18</a>. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his
	 heart by envy and malice. How foolish to consult those whom, according to God's law, he had endeavoured to root out!</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Sam.28.7-1Sam.28.19"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="x.xxviii-p9.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="x.xxviii-p9.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iSam.28.html#iSam.28.7">7–19</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="x.xxviii-p10">When we go from the plain path of duty, every thing draws us further aside, and increases our perplexity and temptation. Saul desires the woman to bring one from the dead, with whom he wished to speak; this was expressly forbidden, <a class="scripRef" id="x.xxviii-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Deut.18.html#Deut.18.11">De 18:11</a>. All real or pretended witchcraft or conjuration, is a malicious or an ignorant attempt to gain knowledge or help from some creature, when it cannot be had from the Lord in the path of duty. While Samuel was
	 living, we never read of Saul's going to advise with him in any difficulties; it had been well for him if he had. But now he is dead, “Bring me up Samuel.” Many who despise and persecute God's saints and ministers when living, would be glad to have them again, when they are gone. The whole shows that it was no human fraud or trick. Though the woman could not cause Samuel's being sent, yet Saul's inquiry might be the occasion of it. The woman's surprise and terror proved that it was an
	 unusual and unexpected appearance. Saul had despised Samuel's solemn warnings in his lifetime, yet now that he hoped, as in defiance of God, to obtain some counsel and encouragement from him, might not God permit the soul of his departed prophet to appear to Saul, to confirm his former sentence, and denounce his doom? The expression, “Thou and thy sons shall be with me,” means no more than that they shall be in the eternal world. There appears much solemnity in God's permitting the soul of
	 a departed prophet to come as a witness from heaven, to confirm the word he had spoken on earth.</p>

  <p id="x.xxviii-p11">Those that expect any good counsel or comfort, otherwise than from God, and in the way of his institutions, will be as wretchedly disappointed as Saul. Though terrified even to despair, he was not humbled. He confessed not his sins, offered no sacrifices, and presented no supplications. He does not seem to have cared about his sons or his people, or to have attempted any escape; but in sullen despair he rushed upon his doom. God sets up a few such beacons, to warn men not to stifle
	 convictions, or despise his word. But while one repenting thought remains, let no sinner suppose himself in this case. Let him humble himself before God, determined to live and die beseeching his favour, and he will succeed.</p>
