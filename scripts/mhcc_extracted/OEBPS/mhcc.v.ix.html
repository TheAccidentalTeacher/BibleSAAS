  <p id="v.ix-p7">God gave particular orders for the keeping of this passover, and, for aught that appears, after this, they kept no passover till they came to Canaan, <a class="scripRef" id="v.ix-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Josh.5.html#Josh.5.10">Jos 5:10</a>. It early showed that the ceremonial institutions were not to continue always, as so soon after they were appointed, some were suffered to sleep for many years. But the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was not thus set aside in the first days of the Christian church, although those were
	 days of greater difficulty and distress than Israel knew in the wilderness; nay, in the times of persecution, the Lord's Supper was celebrated more frequently than afterward. Israelites in the wilderness could not forget the deliverance out of Egypt. There was danger of this when they came to Canaan. Instructions were given concerning those who were ceremonially unclean, when they were to eat the passover. Those whose minds and consciences are defiled by sin, are unfit for communion with God,
	 and cannot partake with comfort of the gospel passover, till they are cleansed by true repentance and faith. Observe with what trouble and concern these men complained that they were kept back from offering to the Lord. It should be a trouble to us, when by any occasion we are kept back from the solemnities of a sabbath or a sacrament. Observe the deliberation of Moses in resolving this case. Ministers must ask counsel of God's mouth, not determine according to their own fancy or affection, but
	 according to the word of God to the best of their knowledge. And if, in difficult cases, time is taken to spread the matter before God by humble, believing prayer, the Holy Spirit assuredly will direct in the good and right way. God gave directions in this case, and in other similar cases, explanatory of the law of the passover. As those who, against their minds, are forced to absent themselves from God's ordinances, may expect the favours of God's grace under their affliction, so those who, of
	 choice, absent themselves, may expect God's wrath for their sin. Be not deceived: God is not mocked.</p>

  <p id="v.ix-p8">This cloud was appointed to be the visible sign and symbol of God's presence with Israel. Thus we are taught to see God always near us, both night and day. As long as the cloud rested on the tabernacle, so long they continued in the same place. There is no time lost, while we are waiting God's time. When the cloud was taken up, they removed, however comfortably they were encamped. We are kept at uncertainty concerning the time of our putting off the earthly house of this tabernacle,
	 that we may be always ready to remove at the command of the Lord. It is very safe and pleasant going when we see God before us, and resting where he appoints us to rest. The leading of this cloud is spoken of as signifying the guidance of the blessed Spirit. We are not now to expect such tokens of the Divine presence and guidance; but the promise is sure to all God's spiritual Israel, that he will guide them by his counsel. <a class="scripRef" id="v.ix-p8.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.73.html#Ps.73.24">Ps 73:24</a>, even unto death,
	 <a class="scripRef" id="v.ix-p8.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.48.html#Ps.48.14">Ps 48:14</a>. All the children of God shall be led by the Spirit of God, <a class="scripRef" id="v.ix-p8.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rom.8.html#Rom.8.14">Ro 8:14</a>. He will direct the paths of those who in all their ways acknowledge him, <a class="scripRef" id="v.ix-p8.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.3.html#Prov.3.6">Pr 3:6</a>. At the commandment of the Lord, our hearts should always move and rest, saying, Father, thy will be done; dispose of me and mine as thou pleasest. What thou wilt, and where thou wilt; only let me be thine, and always in the
	 way of my duty. In applying general precepts to particular circumstances, there should be good counsel and fervent prayer. When any undertaking is evidently wrong, or doubtfully right, and yet the mind leans that way, in such a case “the moving of the cloud,” as men sometimes miscall it, is generally no more than a temptation Satan is permitted to propose; and men fancy they are following the Lord, when they are following their own wayward inclinations. The record of his mercy will conduct
	 us with unerring truth, through Christ, to everlasting peace. Follow the pillar of the cloud and of fire. Lay the BIBLE to heart, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
