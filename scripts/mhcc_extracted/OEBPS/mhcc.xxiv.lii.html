      <p id="xxiv.lii-p1">  The welcome news of Christ's kingdom. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.52.html#Isa.52.1">Is. 52:1-12</a>) The humiliation of the Messiah. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.52.html#Isa.52.13">Is. 52:13-15</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.52.html#Isa.52.1">Is. 52:1-12</a></b>  The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Let those weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief in Christ, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, and loose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer for our salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but his own precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and how hurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value the redemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin, recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every follower of Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himself brought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings: keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they are beautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen could scarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud of their afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainly see the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all the world will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation by Christ. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all in the bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed. They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; but they were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty, are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will not hasten for fear.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.52.html#Isa.52.13">Is. 52:13-15</a></b>  Here begins that wonderful, minute, and faithful description of the office, character, and glory of the Messiah, which has struck conviction to many of the most hardened unbelievers. Christ is Wisdom itself; in the work of our redemption there appeared the wisdom of God in a mystery. Those that saw him, said, Surely never man looked so miserable: never was sorrow like unto his sorrow. But God highly exalted him. That shall be discovered by the gospel of Christ, which could never be told in any other way. And Christ having once shed his blood for sinners, its power still continues. May all opposers see the wisdom of ceasing from their opposition, and be made partakers of the blood of sprinkling, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost; obeying him, and praising his salvation.</p>
