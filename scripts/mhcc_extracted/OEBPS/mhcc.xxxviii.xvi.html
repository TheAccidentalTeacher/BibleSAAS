  <p id="xxxviii.xvi-p11">The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iTim.6.html#iTim.6.17">1Ti 6:17</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iTim.6.html#iTim.6.18">18</a>. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p11.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.10.html#Prov.10.4">Pr 10:4</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p11.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Prov.10.html#Prov.10.22">22</a>. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the
	 people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p11.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jas.4.html#Jas.4.15">Jas 4:15</a>.
	 Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</p>

  <p id="xxxviii.xvi-p12">Timothy came to do the work of the Lord. Therefore to vex his spirit, would be to grieve the Holy Spirit; to despise him, would be to despise Him that sent him. Those who work the work of the Lord, should be treated with tenderness and respect. Faithful ministers will not be jealous of each other. It becomes the ministers of the gospel to show concern for each other's reputation and usefulness.</p>

  <p id="xxxviii.xvi-p13">A Christian is always in danger, therefore should ever be on the watch. He should be fixed in the faith of the gospel, and never desert or give it up. By this faith alone he will be able to keep his ground in an hour of temptation. Christians should be careful that charity not only reigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a great difference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth and transport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who served the
	 cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those who desire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them, are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledge the worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxviii.xvi-p13.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Cor.16.19-1Cor.16.24"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxviii.xvi-p13.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.xvi-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.16.html#iCor.16.19">19–24</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxviii.xvi-p14">Christianity by no means destroys civility. Religion should promote a courteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea of religion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to be sour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere empty compliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, and commend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian family should be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gathered together in
	 the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is a church. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much in their mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love him in truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many are Christians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity. Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Those who love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let us not rest in any
	 religious profession where there is not the love of Christ, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies, and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that our friends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good. And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We can wish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. True Christianity makes us
	 wish those whom we love, the blessings of both worlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them. The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them of their faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with a solemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our love be with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all things appear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and his righteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known
	 sin, or in the neglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we may judge of the state of our souls.</p>
