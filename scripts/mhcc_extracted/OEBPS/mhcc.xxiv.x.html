      <p id="xxiv.x-p1">  Woes against proud oppressors. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.x-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.10.html#Isa.10.1">Is. 10:1-4</a>) The Assyrian but an instrument in the hand of God for the punishment of his people.

(<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.x-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.10.html#Isa.10.20">Is. 10:20-34</a>)</p>

Woe to the superior powers that devise and decree unrighteous decrees! And woe to the inferior officers that draw them up, and enter them on record! But what will sinners do? Whither will they flee?</p>

      <p id="xxiv.x-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.x-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.10.html#Isa.10.5">Is. 10:5-19</a></b>  See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?</p>
      <p id="xxiv.x-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.x-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.x-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.10.html#Isa.10.20">Is. 10:20-34</a></b>  By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, "because of the anointing;" for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.x-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.10.html#Isa.10.28">Is. 10:28-34</a>, a prophetical description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to us.</p>
