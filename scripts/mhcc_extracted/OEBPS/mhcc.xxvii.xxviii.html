      <p id="xxvii.xxviii-p1">  The sentence against the prince or king of Tyre. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxviii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.28.html#Ezek.28.1">Ezek. 28:1-19</a>) The fall of Zidon. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxviii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.28.html#Ezek.28.20">Ezek. 28:20-23</a>) The restoration of Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxviii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.28.html#Ezek.28.24">Ezek. 28:24-26</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxviii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxviii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.28.html#Ezek.28.1">Ezek. 28:1-19</a></b>  Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxviii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxviii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.28.html#Ezek.28.20">Ezek. 28:20-26</a>.</b>  The Zidonians were borderers upon the land of Israel, and they might have learned to glorify the Lord; but, instead of that, they seduced Israel to the worship of their idols. War and pestilence are God's messengers; but he will be glorified in the restoring his people to their former safety and prosperity. God will cure them of their sins, and ease them of their troubles. This promise will at length fully come to pass in the heavenly Canaan: when all the saints shall be gathered together, every thing that offends shall be removed, all griefs and fears for ever banished. Happy, then, is the church of God, and every living member of it, though poor, afflicted, and despised; for the Lord will display his truth, power, and mercy, in the salvation and happiness of his redeemed people.</p>
