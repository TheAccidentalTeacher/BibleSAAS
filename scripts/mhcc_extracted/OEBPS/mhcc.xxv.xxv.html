      <h2 id="xxv.xxv-p0.2">Chapter 25</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p1">  The Jews rebuked for not obeying calls to repentance. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.1">Jer. 25:1-7</a>) Their captivity during seventy years is expressly foretold. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.8">Jer. 25:8-14</a>) Desolations upon the nations shown by the emblem of a cup of wrath. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.15">Jer. 25:15-29</a>) The judgments again declared. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.30">Jer. 25:30-38</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.1">Jer. 25:1-7</a></b>  The call to turn from evil ways to the worship and service of God, and for sinners to trust in Christ, and partake of his salvation, concerns all men. God keeps an account how long we possess the means of grace; and the longer we have them, the heavier will our account be if we have not improved them. Rising early, points out the earnest desire that this people should turn and live. Personal and particular reformation must be insisted on as necessary to a national deliverance; and every one must turn from his own evil way. Yet all was to no purpose. They would not take the right and only method to turn away the wrath of God.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.8">Jer. 25:8-14</a></b>  The fixing of the time during which the Jewish captivity should last, would not only confirm the prophecy, but also comfort the people of God, and encourage faith and prayer. The ruin of Babylon is foretold: the rod will be thrown into the fire when the correcting work is done. When the set time to favour Zion is come, Babylon shall be punished for their iniquity, as other nations have been punished for their sins. Every threatening of the Scripture will certainly be accomplished.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.15">Jer. 25:15-29</a></b>  The evil and the good events of life are often represented in Scripture as cups. Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power. And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not the wicked expect to escape.</p>

      <p id="xxv.xxv-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxv-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.25.html#Jer.25.30">Jer. 25:30-38</a></b>  The Lord has just ground of controversy with every nation and every person; and he will execute judgment on all the wicked. Who can avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fully come; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make the nations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the common calamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing to provoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceable habitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve his church and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate them from his love.</p>
