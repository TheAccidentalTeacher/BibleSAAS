  <p id="xviii.i-p7">The pride of Ahasuerus's heart rising with the grandeur of his kingdom, he made an extravagant feast. This was vain glory. Better is a dinner of herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noise and tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in the heart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another, will be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drank to excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen
	 prince, even when he would show his generosity, may shame many called Christians, who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sin round, and death with it. There is a woe to them that do so; let them read it, and tremble, <a class="scripRef" id="xviii.i-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hab.2.html#Hab.2.15">Hab 2:15</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xviii.i-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hab.2.html#Hab.2.16">16</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="s02" id="xviii.i-p7.4"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xviii.i-p7.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Esth.1.html#Esth.1.10">10–22</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xviii.i-p8">Ahasuerus's feast ended in heaviness, by his own folly. Seasons of peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in, men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it
	 had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.</p>
