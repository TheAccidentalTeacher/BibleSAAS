      <h1 id="x-p0.1">1 Samuel</h1>
      <p id="x-p1">In this book we have an account of Eli, and the wickedness of his sons; also of Samuel, his character and actions. Then of the advancement of Saul to be the king of Israel, and his ill behaviour, until his death made way for David's succession to the throne, who was an eminent type of Christ. David's patience, modesty, constancy, persecution by open enemies and feigned friends, are a pattern and example to the church, and to every member of it. Many things in this book encourage the
  faith, hope, and patience of the suffering believer. It contains also many useful cautions and awful warnings.</p>
