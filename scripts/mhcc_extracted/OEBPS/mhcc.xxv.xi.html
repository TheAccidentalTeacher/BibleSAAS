      <p id="xxv.xi-p1">  The disobedient Jews reproved. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.1">Jer. 11:1-10</a>) Their utter ruin. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.11">Jer. 11:11-17</a>) The people would be destroyed who sought the prophet's life. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.18">Jer. 11:18-23</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.1">Jer. 11:1-10</a></b>  God never promised to bestow blessings on his rational creatures, while they persist in wilful disobedience. Pardon and acceptance are promised freely to all believers; but no man can be saved who does not obey the command of God to repent, to believe in Christ, to separate from sin and the world, to choose self-denial and newness of life. In general, men will hearken to those who speak of doctrines, promises, and privileges; but when duties are mentioned, they will not bend their ear.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.11">Jer. 11:11-17</a></b>  Evil pursues sinners, and entangles them in snares, out of which they cannot free themselves. Now, in their distress, their many gods and many altars stand them in no stead. And those whose own prayers will not be heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers of others. Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction. The remembrance of God's former favours to them shall be no comfort under troubles; and his remembrance of them shall be no argument for their relief. Every sin against the Lord is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found sooner or later.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.11.html#Jer.11.18">Jer. 11:18-23</a></b>  The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.</p>
