  <p id="xii.vi-p9">The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed and modelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never
	 further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, <a class="scripRef" id="xii.vi-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Mark.5.html#Mark.5.27">Mr 5:27</a>.</p>

  <p id="xii.vi-p10">None employ themselves for God, without having his eye upon them. But God plainly let Solomon know that all the charge for building this temple, would neither excuse from obedience to the law of God, nor shelter from his judgments, in case of disobedience.</p>

  <p id="xii.vi-p11">See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, <a class="scripRef" id="xii.vi-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.3.html#iCor.3.16">1Co 3:16</a>. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy
	 temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.</p>
