      <h1 id="xxxiii-p0.1">Mark</h1>
      <p id="xxxiii-p1">Mark was a sister's son to Barnabas, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Col.4.html#Col.4.10">Col 4:10</a>; and <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Acts.12.html#Acts.12.12">Ac 12:12</a> shows that he was the son of Mary, a pious woman of Jerusalem, at whose house the apostles and first Christians assembled. From Peter's styling him his son, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iPet.5.html#iPet.5.13">1Pe 5:13</a>, the evangelist is supposed to have been converted by that apostle. Thus Mark was closely united with the followers of our Lord, if not himself
  one of the number. Mark wrote at Rome; some suppose that Peter dictated to him, though the general testimony is, that the apostle having preached at Rome, Mark, who was the apostle's companion, and had a clear understanding of what Peter delivered, was desired to commit the particulars to writing. And we may remark, that the great humility of Peter is very plain where any thing is said about himself. Scarcely an action or a work of Christ is mentioned, at which this apostle was not present, and
  the minuteness shows that the facts were related by an eye-witness. This Gospel records more of the miracles than of the discourses of our Lord, and though in many things it relates the same things as the Gospel according to St. Matthew, we may reap advantages from reviewing the same events, placed by each of the evangelists in that point of view which most affected his own mind.</p>
