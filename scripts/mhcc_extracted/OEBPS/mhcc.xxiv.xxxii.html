      <p id="xxiv.xxxii-p1">  Times of peace and happiness. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.32.html#Isa.32.1">Is. 32:1-8</a>) An interval of trouble, yet comfort and blessings in the end. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.32.html#Isa.32.9">Is. 32:9-20</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxxii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.32.html#Isa.32.1">Is. 32:1-8</a></b>  Christ our righteous King, and his true disciples, are evidently here intended. The consolations and graces of his Spirit are as rivers of water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rock affords refreshing shade and shelter to the weary traveller in the desert, so his power, truth, and love, yield the believer the only real protection and refreshment in the weary land through which he journeys to heaven. Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxxii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.32.html#Isa.32.9">Is. 32:9-20</a></b>  When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support self-indulgence by shameful niggardliness! We deserve to be deprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.</p>
