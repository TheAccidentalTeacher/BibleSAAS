  <p id="iii.xxxix-p7">The priests' garments were rich and splendid. The church in its infancy was thus taught by shadows of good things to come; but the substance is Christ, and the grace of the gospel. Christ is our great High Priest. When he undertook the work of our redemption, he put on the clothes of service, he arrayed himself with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, girded himself with resolution to go through the undertaking, took charge of all God's spiritual Israel, laid them near his heart,
	 engraved them on the palms of his hands, and presented them to his Father. And he crowned himself with holiness to the Lord, consecrating his whole undertaking to the honour of his Father's holiness. True believers are spiritual priests. The clean linen with which all their clothes of service must be made, is the righteousness of saints, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxxix-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.19.html#Rev.19.8">Re 19:8</a>.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Exod.39.32-Exod.39.43"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="iii.xxxix-p7.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxxix-p7.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Exod.39.html#Exod.39.32">32–43</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="iii.xxxix-p8">The tabernacle was a type or emblem of Jesus Christ. As the Most High dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxxix-p8.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Col.2.html#Col.2.9">Col 2:9</a>. The tabernacle was a symbol of every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his blessings. The
	 tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem of the heavenly temple, <a class="scripRef" id="iii.xxxix-p8.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.21.html#Rev.21.3">Re 21:3</a>. What, then, will be the splendour of His appearance, when the cloud shall be withdrawn, and his faithful worshippers shall see him as he is!</p>
