      <h2 id="xxv.xxvi-p0.2">Chapter 26</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p1">  The destruction of the temple and city foretold. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.1">Jer. 26:1-6</a>) Jeremiah's life is threatened. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.7">Jer. 26:7-15</a>) He is defended by the elders. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.16">Jer. 26:16-24</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.1">Jer. 26:1-6</a></b>  God's ambassadors must not seek to please men, or to save themselves from harm. See how God waits to be gracious. If they persisted in disobedience, it would ruin their city and temple. Can any thing else be expected? Those who will not be subject to the commands of God, make themselves subject to the curse of God.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.7">Jer. 26:7-15</a></b>  The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deserving death, and bore false witness against him. The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxvi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxvi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.26.html#Jer.26.16">Jer. 26:16-24</a></b>  When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.</p>
