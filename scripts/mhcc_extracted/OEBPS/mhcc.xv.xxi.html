      <p id="xv.xxi-p1">
        <b>The reign of Ahaziah, Athaliah destroys the royal family.</b>
      </p>
      <p id="xv.xxi-p2">—The counsel of the ungodly ruins many young persons when they are setting out in the world. Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, <a class="scripRef" id="xv.xxi-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.18.html#Rev.18.4">Re 18:4</a>. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of
	 David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power. But God had purposed, and vain were the efforts of earth and hell.</p>
