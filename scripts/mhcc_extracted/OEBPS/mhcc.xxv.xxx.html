      <p id="xxv.xxx-p1">  Troubles which shall be before the restoration of Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.1">Jer. 30:1-11</a>) Encouragement to trust Divine promises. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.12">Jer. 30:12-17</a>) The blessings under Christ, and the wrath on the wicked. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.18">Jer. 30:18-24</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxv.xxx-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.1">Jer. 30:1-11</a></b>  Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxx-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxx-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.12">Jer. 30:12-17</a></b>  When God is against a people, who will be for them? Who can be for them, so as to do them any kindness? Incurable griefs are owing to incurable lusts. Yet, though the captives suffered justly, and could not help themselves, the Lord intended to appear for them, and to punish their oppressors; and he will still do so. But every effort to heal ourselves must prove fruitless, so long as we neglect the heavenly Advocate and sanctifying Spirit. The dealings of His grace with every true convert, and every returning backslider, are the same in effect as his proceedings to the Jews.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxx-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxx-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxx-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.30.html#Jer.30.18">Jer. 30:18-24</a></b>  We have here further intimations of the favour of God for them after the days of their calamity have expired. The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. "I will be your God:" it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. How will they escape who neglect so great salvation?</p>
