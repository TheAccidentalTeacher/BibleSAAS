      <h2 id="xxv.xlii-p0.2">Chapter 42</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xlii-p1">  Johanan desires Jeremiah to ask counsel of God. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.42.html#Jer.42.1">Jer. 42:1-6</a>) They are assured of safety in Judea, but of destruction in Egypt. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.42.html#Jer.42.7">Jer. 42:7-22</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xlii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xlii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.42.html#Jer.42.1">Jer. 42:1-6</a></b>  To serve a turn, Jeremiah is sought out, and the captains ask for his assistance. In every difficult, doubtful case, we must look to God for direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided by a spirit of wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We do not truly desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve to comply with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lord requires, while they hope to have their pride flattered, and their favourite lusts spared. Yet something betrays the state of their hearts.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xlii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xlii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.42.html#Jer.42.7">Jer. 42:7-22</a></b>  If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.</p>
