      <p id="xxiv.xxxiii-p1">  God's judgments against the enemies of his church. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxiii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.33.html#Isa.33.1">Is. 33:1-14</a>) The happiness of his people. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxiii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.33.html#Isa.33.15">Is. 33:15-24</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxxiii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxiii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.33.html#Isa.33.1">Is. 33:1-14</a></b>  Here we have the proud and false destroyer justly reckoned with for all his fraud and violence. The righteous God often pays sinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God, shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. If God leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must every morning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do the work of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. True wisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders us stedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure which can never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was brought into, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when all other helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledge that he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answer for, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands of the word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burn those everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire that shall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath of an ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxxiii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xxxiii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxxiii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.33.html#Isa.33.15">Is. 33:15-24</a></b>  The true believer watches against all occasions of sin. The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power will keep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing of salvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believing prayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walk uprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, but they shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beauty of holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add to the pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in our own houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in every age Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large river running by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. We have all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christ for our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. All that refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of their souls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is the taking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason to complain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, not only to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but to heaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth out our transgressions, will heal our souls.</p>
