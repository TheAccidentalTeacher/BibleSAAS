      <h1 id="xvi-p0.1">Ezra</h1>
      <p id="xvi-p1">The history of this book is the accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecy concerning the return of the Jews out of Babylon. From its contents we especially learn, that every good work will meet with opposition from enemies, and be hurt by the misconduct of friends; but that God will make his cause to prevail, notwithstanding all obstacles and adversaries. The restoration of the Jews was an event of the highest consequence, tending to preserve religion in the world, and preparing the way
  for the appearance of the Great Deliverer, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
