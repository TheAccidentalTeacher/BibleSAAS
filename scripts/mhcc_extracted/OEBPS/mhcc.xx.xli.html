  <p id="xx.xli-p7">The people of God are not free from poverty, sickness, or outward affliction, but the Lord will consider their case, and send due supplies. From his Lord's example the believer learns to consider his poor and afflicted brethren. This branch of godliness is usually recompensed with temporal blessings. But nothing is so distressing to the contrite believer, as a fear or sense of the Divine displeasure, or of sin in his heart. Sin is the sickness of the soul; pardoning mercy heals it,
	 renewing grace heals it, and for this spiritual healing we should be more earnest than for bodily health.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Ps.41.5-Ps.41.13"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xx.xli-p7.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xli-p7.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.41.html#Ps.41.5">5–13</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xx.xli-p8">We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there is scarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former days were no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure
	 in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.</p>
