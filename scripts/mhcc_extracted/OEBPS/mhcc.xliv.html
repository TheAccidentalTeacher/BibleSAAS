      <h1 id="xliv-p0.1">1 Thessalonians</h1>
      <p id="xliv-p1">This epistle is generally considered to have been the first of those written by St. Paul. The occasion seems to have been the good report of the stedfastness of the church at Thessalonica in the faith of the gospel. It is full of affection and confidence, and more consolatory and practical, and less doctrinal, than some of the other epistles.</p>
