  <p id="xxxii.i-p7">Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention. It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.12.html#Gen.12.3">Ge 12:3</a>;
	 <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.22.html#Gen.22.18">22:18</a>; and to David that he should descend from him, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iiSam.7.html#iiSam.7.12">2Sa 7:12</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.89.html#Ps.89.3">Ps 89:3</a>, &amp;c.; <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.132.html#Ps.132.11">132:11</a>; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition;
	 but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.</p>

  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxii.i-p7.7"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxii.i-p7.8" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.1.html#Matt.1.18">18–25</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxii.i-p8">Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God entered into this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours of this world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the
	 unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the
	 power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives,
	 particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.</p>
