      <p id="xxvii.vi-p1">  The Divine judgments for idolatry. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.1">Ezek. 6:1-7</a>) A remnant shall be saved. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.8">Ezek. 6:8-10</a>) The calamities are to be lamented. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.11">Ezek. 6:11-14</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.1">Ezek. 6:1-7</a>.</b>  War desolates persons, places, and things esteemed most sacred. God ruins idolatries even by the hands of idolaters. It is just with God to make that a desolation, which we make an idol. The superstitions to which many trust for safety, often cause their ruin. And the day is at hand, when idols and idolatry will be as thoroughly destroyed from the professedly Christian church as they were from among the Jews.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.8">Ezek. 6:8-10</a></b>  A remnant of Israel should be left; at length they should remember the Lord, their obligations to him, and rebellion against him. True penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin. They give glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men to remember Him, and their sins against him, should be regarded as a blessing.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.vi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.vi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.6.html#Ezek.6.11">Ezek. 6:11-14</a></b>  It is our duty to be affected, not only with our own sins and sufferings, but to look with compassion upon the miseries wicked people bring upon themselves. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore, stand in awe, and sin not. If we know the worth of souls, and the danger to which unbelievers are exposed, we shall deem every sinner who takes refuge in Jesus from the wrath to come, an abundant recompence for all contempt or opposition we may meet with.</p>
