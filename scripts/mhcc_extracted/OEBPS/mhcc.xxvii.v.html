      <h2 id="xxvii.v-p0.2">Chapter 5</h2>
      <p id="xxvii.v-p1">  A type of hair, showing the judgments about to come upon the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.v-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.5.html#Ezek.5.1">Ezek. 5:1-4</a>) These awful judgments are declared. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.v-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.5.html#Ezek.5.5">Ezek. 5:5-17</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.v-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.v-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.v-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.5.html#Ezek.5.1">Ezek. 5:1-4</a></b>  The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard, which signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. One part must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudes that should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cut in pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Another part was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away of some into the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into the neighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the third portion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is very careful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, the fire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.v-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.v-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.v-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.5.html#Ezek.5.5">Ezek. 5:5-17</a></b>  The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, the manner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand in God's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, will perish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will not spare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes, expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's word will prove itself true.</p>
