      <h2 id="xxiv.lxvi-p0.2">Chapter 66</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p1">  God looks at the heart, and vengeance is threatened for guilt. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.1">Is. 66:1-4</a>) The increase of the church, when Jew and Gentile shall be gathered to the Redeemer. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.5">Is. 66:5-14</a>) Every enemy of the church shall be destroyed, and the final ruin of ungodly men shall be seen. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.15">Is. 66:15-24</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.1">Is. 66:1-4</a></b>  The Jews gloried much in their temple. But what satisfaction can the Eternal Mind take in a house made with men's hands? God has a heaven and an earth of his own making, and temples of man's making; but he overlooks them, that he may look with favour to him who is poor in spirit and serious, self-abasing and self-denying; whose heart truly sorrows for sin: such a heart is a living temple for God. The sacrifice of the wicked is not only unacceptable, but a great offence to God. And he that now offers a sacrifice after the law, does in effect set aside Christ's sacrifice. He that burns incense, puts contempt upon the incense of Christ's intercession, and is as if he blessed an idol. Men shall be deceived by the vain confidences with which they deceive themselves. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified consciences, need no more to make them miserable, than to have their own fears brought upon them. Whatever men put in the place of the priesthood, atonement, and intercession of Christ, will be found hateful to God.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.5">Is. 66:5-14</a></b>  The prophet turns to those that trembled at God's word, to comfort and encourage them. The Lord will appear, to the joy of the humble believer, and to the confusion of hypocrites and persecutors. When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel went forth from Zion, multitudes were converted in a little time. The word of God, especially his promises, and ordinances, are the consolations of the church. The true happiness of all Christians is increased by every convert brought to Christ. The gospel brings with it, wherever it is received in its power, such a river of peace, as will carry us to the ocean of boundless and endless bliss. Divine comforts reach the inward man; the joy of the Lord will be the strength of the believer. Both God's mercy and justice shall be manifested, and for ever magnified.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lxvi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.15">Is. 66:15-24</a></b>  A prophetic declaration is given of the Lord's vengeance on all enemies of his church, especially that of all antichristian opposers of the gospel in the latter days. <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lxvi-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.66.html#Isa.66.19">Is. 66:19,20</a>, set forth the abundance of means for conversion of sinners. These expressions are figurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringing God's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall be wanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shall be set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before the Lord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in the world to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked be separated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery and torment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour of that free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of the Lord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphant songs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of the righteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race, Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, that our portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave to his truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive from the Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</p>
