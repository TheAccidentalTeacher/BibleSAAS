      <h2 id="xxvii.xvii-p0.2">Chapter 17</h2>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p1">  A parable relative to the Jewish nation. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.1">Ezek. 17:1-10</a>) to which an explanation is added. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.11">Ezek. 17:11-21</a>) A direct promise of the Messiah. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.22">Ezek. 17:22-24</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.1">Ezek. 17:1-10</a></b>  Mighty conquerors are aptly likened to birds or beasts of prey, but their destructive passions are overruled to forward God's designs. Those who depart from God, only vary their crimes by changing one carnal confidence for another, and never will prosper.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.11">Ezek. 17:11-21</a></b>  The parable is explained, and the particulars of the history of the Jewish nation at that time may be traced. Zedekiah had been ungrateful to his benefactor, which is a sin against God. In every solemn oath, God is appealed to as a witness of the sincerity of him that swears. Truth is a debt owing to all men. If the professors of the true religion deal treacherously with those of a false religion, their profession makes their sin the worse; and God will the more surely and severely punish it. The Lord will not hold those guiltless who take his name in vain; and no man shall escape the righteous judgment of God who dies under unrepented guilt.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.17.html#Ezek.17.22">Ezek. 17:22-24</a></b>  The unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of none effect. The parable of a tree, used in the threatening, is here presented in the promise. It appears only applicable to Jesus, the Son of David, the Messiah of God. The kingdom of Satan, which has borne so long, so large a sway, shall be broken, and the kingdom of Christ, which was looked upon with contempt, shall be established. Blessed be God, our Redeemer is seen even by the ends of the earth. We may find refuge from the wrath to come, and from every enemy and danger, under his shadow; and believers are fruitful in him.</p>
