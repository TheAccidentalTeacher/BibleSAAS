      <h2 id="xxv.xxxii-p0.2">Chapter 32</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p1">  Jeremiah buys a field. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.1">Jer. 32:1-15</a>) The prophet's prayer. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.16">Jer. 32:16-25</a>) God declares that he will give up his people, but promises to restore them. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.26">Jer. 32:26-44</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.1">Jer. 32:1-15</a></b>  Jeremiah, being in prison for his prophecy, purchased a piece of ground. This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.16">Jer. 32:16-25</a></b>  Jeremiah adores the Lord and his infinite perfections. When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, it is good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God is the fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficulty is such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy; that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing for the best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to come upon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we may comfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it. We must not dispute God's will, but we may seek to know what it means.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xxxii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xxxii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.32.html#Jer.32.26">Jer. 32:26-44</a></b>  God's answer discovers the purposes of his wrath against that generation of the Jews, and the purposes of his grace concerning future generations. It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now at length brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had in store for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to all believers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs. He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have a disposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views about lesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; in their views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, the way of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, the vanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom God loves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God's faithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settle them again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed. Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should be made after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faint resemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are kept for all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart from him. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain all the good he has promised us.</p>
