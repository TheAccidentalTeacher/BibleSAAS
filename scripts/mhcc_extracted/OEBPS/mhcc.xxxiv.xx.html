  <p id="xxxiv.xx-p13">Men often pretend to examine the evidences of revelation, and the truth of the gospel, when only seeking excuses for their own unbelief and disobedience. Christ answered these priests and scribes with a plain question about the baptism of John, which the common people could answer. They all knew it was from heaven, nothing in it had an earthly tendency. Those that bury the knowledge they have, are justly denied further knowledge. It was just with Christ to refuse to give account of
	 his authority, to those who knew the baptism of John to be from heaven, yet would not believe in him, nor own their knowledge.</p>
  </div>

  <p id="xxxiv.xx-p14">Christ spake this parable against those who resolved not to own his authority, though the evidence of it was so full. How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess
	 to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.</p>

  <p id="xxxiv.xx-p15">Those who are most crafty in their designs against Christ and his gospel, cannot hide them. He did not give a direct answer, but reproved them for offering to impose upon him; and they could not fasten upon any thing wherewith to stir up either the governor or the people against him. The wisdom which is from above, will direct all who teach the way of God truly, to avoid the snares laid for them by wicked men; and will teach our duty to God, to our rulers, and to all men, so clearly,
	 that opposers will have no evil to say of us.</p>

  <p id="xxxiv.xx-p16">It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, to load it with difficulties. But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by this world of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visible world, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this world and that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares to that which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection from the
	 dead, that is the blessed resurrection. What shall be the happy state of the inhabitants of that world, we cannot express or conceive, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.xx-p16.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.2.html#iCor.2.9">1Co 2:9</a>. Those that are entered into the joy of their Lord, are entirely taken up therewith; when there is perfection of holiness there will be no occasion for preservatives from sin. And when God called himself the God of these patriarchs, he meant that he was a God all-sufficient to them, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.xx-p16.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.17.html#Gen.17.1">Ge
	 17:1</a>, their exceeding great Reward, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.xx-p16.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.15.html#Gen.15.1">Ge 15:1</a>. He never did that for them in this world, which answered the full extent of his undertaking; therefore there must be another life, in which he will do that for them, which will completely fulfil the promise.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxiv.xx-p16.4"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Luke.20.39-Luke.20.47"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxiv.xx-p16.5"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.xx-p16.6" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.20.html#Luke.20.39">39–47</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxiv.xx-p17">The scribes commended the reply Christ made to the Sadducees about the resurrection, but they were silenced by a question concerning the Messiah. Christ, as God, was David's Lord; but Christ, as man, was David's son. The scribes would receive the severest judgement for defrauding the poor widows, and for their abuse of religion, particularly of prayer, which they used as a pretence for carrying on worldly and wicked plans. Dissembled piety is double sin. Then let us beg of God to
	 keep us from pride, ambition, covetousness, and every evil thing; and to teach us to seek that honour which comes from him alone.</p>
