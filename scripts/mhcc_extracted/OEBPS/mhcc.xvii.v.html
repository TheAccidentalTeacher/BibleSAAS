  <p id="xvii.v-p9">Men prey upon their fellow-creatures: by despising the poor they reproach their Maker. Such conduct is a disgrace to any, but who can sufficiently abhor it when adopted by professing Christians? With compassion for the oppressed, we should lament the hardships which many in the world are groaning under; putting our souls into their souls' stead, and remembering in our prayers and succours those who are burdened. But let those who show no mercy, expect judgment without mercy.

  <p id="xvii.v-p10">Nehemiah knew that, if he built Jerusalem's walls ever so high, so thick, or so strong, the city could not be safe while there were abuses. The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a
	 very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, <a class="scripRef" id="xvii.v-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iiCor.8.html#iiCor.8.9">2Co 8:9</a>. They did according to promise. Good promises are good things, but good performances are better.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Neh.5.14-Neh.5.19"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xvii.v-p10.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xvii.v-p10.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Neh.5.html#Neh.5.14">14–19</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xvii.v-p11">Those who truly fear God, will not dare to do any thing cruel or unjust. Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of
	 debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for his people.</p>
