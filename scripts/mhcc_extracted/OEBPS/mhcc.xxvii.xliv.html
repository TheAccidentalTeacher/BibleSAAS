      <p id="xxvii.xliv-p1">  This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in <a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xliv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.44.html#Ezek.44.2">Ezek. 44:2</a>, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.</p>
