      <p id="xxiv.xxv-p1">  A song of praise. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.25.html#Isa.25.1">Is. 25:1-5</a>) A declaration of the gospel blessings.

(<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.25.html#Isa.25.9">Is. 25:9-12</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.25.html#Isa.25.1">Is. 25:1-5</a></b>  However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, it looked further, to the praises that should be offered up to God for Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and the comforts he has provided for all believers. True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided them a shelter, he teaches them to flee unto it.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.25.html#Isa.25.6">Is. 25:6-8</a></b>  The kind reception of repentant sinners, is often in the New Testament likened to a feast. The guests invited are all people, Gentiles as well as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthens and makes glad the heart, and is fit for those who are under convictions of sin, and mourning for it. There is a veil spread over all nations, for all sat in darkness. But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his gospel shining in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive it. He will raise those to spiritual life who were long dead in trespasses and sins. Christ will himself, in his resurrection, triumph over death. Grief shall be banished; there shall be perfect and endless joy. Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted. Those who suffer for Christ shall have consolations. But in the joys of heaven, and not short of them, will fully be brought to pass this saying, God shall wipe away all tears. The hope of this should now do away over-sorrow, all weeping that hinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world God takes away the reproach of his people from among men; however, it will be done fully at the great day. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame now; both will be done away shortly.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.xxv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xxv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.25.html#Isa.25.9">Is. 25:9-12</a></b>  With joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidings of the Redeemer, who looked for him; and with a triumphant song will glorified saints enter into the joy of their Lord. And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
