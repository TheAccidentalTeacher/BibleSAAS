      <h2 id="xxix.vii-p0.2">Chapter 7</h2>
      <p id="xxix.vii-p1">  The manifold sins of Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.vii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.7.html#Hos.7.1">Hos. 7:1-7</a>) Their senselessness and hypocrisy. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxix.vii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.7.html#Hos.7.8">Hos. 7:8-16</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxix.vii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.vii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.7.html#Hos.7.1">Hos. 7:1-7</a></b>  A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.</p>

      <p id="xxix.vii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxix.vii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.7.html#Hos.7.8">Hos. 7:8-16</a></b>  Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.</p>
