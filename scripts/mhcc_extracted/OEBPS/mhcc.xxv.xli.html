      <p id="xxv.xli-p1">  Ishmael murders Gedaliah. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xli-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.41.html#Jer.41.1">Jer. 41:1-10</a>) Johanan recovers the captives, and purposes to retire to Egypt. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xli-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.41.html#Jer.41.11">Jer. 41:11-18</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxv.xli-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xli-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.41.html#Jer.41.1">Jer. 41:1-10</a></b>  Those who hate the worshippers of God, often put on the appearance of piety, that they may the easier hurt them. As death often meets men where they least expect it, we should continually search whether we are in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish to be found in when called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes the ransom of a man's life is his riches. But those who think to bribe death, saying, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, will find themselves wretchedly deceived. This melancholy history warns us, never to be secure in this world. We never can be sure of peace on this side heaven.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xli-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xli-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xli-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.41.html#Jer.41.11">Jer. 41:11-18</a></b>  The success of villany must be short, and none can prosper who harden their hearts against God. And those justly lose comfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears. The removal of a prudent and peaceable ruler, and the succession of another who is rash and ambitious, affects the welfare of many. Only those are happy and steady who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.</p>
