  <p id="ii.xxxi-p11">The affairs of these families are related very minutely, while (what are called) the great events of states and kingdoms at that period, are not mentioned. The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, how to serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good in the various stations and duties of life. Selfish men consider themselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness will even swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth is that
	 error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. The men of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to be taking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. But there are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seek them in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect to the command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. The perils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can really encourage our
	 hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion with God, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should often recollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Gen.31.22-Gen.31.35"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="ii.xxxi-p11.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxi-p11.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.31.html#Gen.31.22">22–35</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="ii.xxxi-p12">God can put a bridle in the mouth of wicked men, to restrain their malice, though he do not change their hearts. Though they have no love to God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit of necessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could be stolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their cause to God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness and
	 fear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what a scene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrous Chaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. The truth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who sware by the Lord and by Malcham, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxi-p12.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Zeph.1.html#Zeph.1.5">Zep 1:5</a>; and like others in our times, who wish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge the true God in words, but their hearts and
	 houses are the abodes of spiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, like Laban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among gross idolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of their abominations.</p>

  <p id="ii.xxxi-p13">If Jacob were willingly consumed with heat in the day, and frost by night, to become the son-in-law of Laban, what should we refuse to endure, to become the sons of God? Jacob speaks of God as the God of his father; he thought himself unworthy to be regarded, but was beloved for his father's sake. He calls him the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac; for Abraham was dead, and gone to that world where perfect love casts out fear; but Isaac was yet alive, sanctifying the Lord in his
	 heart, as his fear and his dread.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Gen.31.43-Gen.31.55"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="ii.xxxi-p13.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxi-p13.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.31.html#Gen.31.43">43–55</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="ii.xxxi-p14">Laban could neither justify himself nor condemn Jacob, therefore desires to hear no more of that matter. He is not willing to own himself in fault, as he ought to have done. But he proposes a covenant of friendship between them, to which Jacob readily agrees. A heap of stones was raised, to keep up the memory of the event, writing being then not known or little used. A sacrifice of peace offerings was offered. Peace with God puts true comfort into our peace with our friends. They did
	 eat bread together, partaking of the feast upon the sacrifice. In ancient times covenants of friendship were ratified by the parties eating and drinking together. God is judge between contending parties, and he will judge righteously; whoever do wrong, it is at their peril. They gave a new name to the place, The heap of witness. After this angry parley, they part friends. God is often better to us than our fears, and overrules the spirits of men in our favour, beyond what we could have
	 expected; for it is not in vain to trust in him.</p>
