  <h3 class="s02" id="xx.xviii-p8.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p8.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.18.html#Ps.18.1">1–19</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xx.xviii-p9">The first words, “I will love thee, O Lord, my strength,” are the scope and contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is
	 very fully described, ver. #(<a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.18.html#Ps.18.7">7–15</a>). Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up
	 under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p9.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Heb.5.html#Heb.5.7">Heb 5:7</a>. God made the earth to
	 shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Ps.18.20-Ps.18.28"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xx.xviii-p9.4"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p9.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.18.html#Ps.18.20">20–28</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xx.xviii-p10">Those that forsake the ways of the Lord, depart from their God. But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be.
	 The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lev.26.html#Lev.26.21">Le 26:21–24</a>. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; “Thou wilt bring down high looks.” And he speaks encouragement to
	 himself; “Thou wilt light my candle:” thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Ps.18.29-Ps.18.50"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xx.xviii-p10.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p10.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.18.html#Ps.18.29">29–50</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xx.xviii-p11">When we praise for one mercy, we must observe the many more, with which we have been compassed all our days. Many things had contributed to David's advancement, and he owns the hand of God in them all, to teach us to do likewise. In verse #(<a class="scripRef" id="xx.xviii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.18.html#Ps.18.32">32</a>), and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made
	 through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be
	 destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.</p>
