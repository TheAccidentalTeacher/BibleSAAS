      <h2 id="xxiv.xiii-p0.2">Chapter 13</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p1">  The armies of God's wrath. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.1">Is. 13:1-5</a>) The conquest of Babylon. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.6">Is. 13:6-18</a>) Its final desolation. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.19">Is. 13:19-22</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.1">Is. 13:1-5</a></b>  The threatenings of God's word press heavily upon the wicked, and are a sore burden, too heavy for them to bear. The persons brought together to lay Babylon waste, are called God's sanctified or appointed ones; designed for this service, and made able to do it. They are called God's mighty ones, because they had their might from God, and were now to use it for him. They come from afar. God can make those a scourge and ruin to his enemies, who are farthest off, and therefore least dreaded.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.6">Is. 13:6-18</a></b>  We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by the Medes and Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must expect to share her plagues, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p5.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.18.html#Rev.18.4">Rev. 18:4</a>. All that men have, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believed these things.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xiii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xiii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.13.html#Isa.13.19">Is. 13:19-22</a></b>  Babylon was a noble city; yet it should be wholly destroyed. None shall dwell there. It shall be a haunt for wild beasts. All this is fulfilled. The fate of this proud city is a proof of the truth of the Bible, and an emblem of the approaching ruin of the New Testament Babylon; a warning to sinners to flee from the wrath to come, and it encourages believers to expect victory over every enemy of their souls, and of the church of God. The whole world changes and is liable to decay. Wherefore let us give diligence to obtain a kingdom which cannot be moved; and in this hope let us hold fast that grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</p>
