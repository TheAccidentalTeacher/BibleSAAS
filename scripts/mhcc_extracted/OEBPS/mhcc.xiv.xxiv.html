        <b>The divisions of the priests and Levites.</b>

      <p id="xiv.xxiv-p2">—When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the more there are the better. In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all be
	 children of the Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his temple above.</p>
