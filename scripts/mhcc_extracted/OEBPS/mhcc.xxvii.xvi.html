      <p id="xxvii.xvi-p1">  A parable showing the first low estate of the Jewish nation, its prosperity, idolatries, and punishment.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xvi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.16.html#Ezek.16.1">Ezek. 16:1-58</a></b>  In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xvi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xvi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.16.html#Ezek.16.59">Ezek. 16:59-63</a></b>  After a full warning of judgments, mercy is remembered, mercy is reserved. These closing verses are a precious promise, in part fulfilled at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out of Babylon, but to have fuller accomplishment in gospel times. The Divine mercy should be powerful to melt our hearts into godly sorrow for sin. Nor will God ever leave the sinner to perish, who is humbled for his sins, and comes to trust in His mercy and grace through Jesus Christ; but will keep him by his power, through faith unto salvation.</p>
