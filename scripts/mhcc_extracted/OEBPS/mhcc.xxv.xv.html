      <h2 id="xxv.xv-p0.2">Chapter 15</h2>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p1">  The destruction of the wicked described. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.1">Jer. 15:1-9</a>) The prophet laments such messages, and is reproved. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.10">Jer. 15:10-14</a>) He supplicates pardon, and is promised protection. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.15">Jer. 15:15-21</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.1">Jer. 15:1-9</a></b>  The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.10">Jer. 15:10-14</a></b>  Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when they ought to have blessed him, and God for him. It is a great and sufficient support to the people of God, that however troublesome their way may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end. God turns to the people. Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well. But the people who had great estates would be used hardly. All parts of the country had added to the national guilt; and let each take shame to itself.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.15.html#Jer.15.15">Jer. 15:15-21</a></b>  It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.</p>
