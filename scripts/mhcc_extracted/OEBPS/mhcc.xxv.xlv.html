      <p id="xxv.xlv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xlv-p3">  Baruch was employed in writing Jeremiah's prophecies, and reading them, see <a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.36.html">Jer. 36</a>, and was threatened for it by the king. Young beginners in religion are apt to be discouraged with little difficulties, which they commonly meet with at first in the service of God. These complaints and fears came from his corruptions. Baruch had raised his expectations too high in this world, and that made the distress and trouble he was in harder to be borne. The frowns of the world would not disquiet us, if we did not foolishly flatter ourselves with the hopes of its smiles, and court and covet them. What a folly is it then to seek great things for ourselves here, where every thing is little, and nothing certain! The Lord knows the real cause of our fretfulness and despondency better than we do, and we should beg of him to examine our hearts, and to repress every wrong desire in us.</p>
