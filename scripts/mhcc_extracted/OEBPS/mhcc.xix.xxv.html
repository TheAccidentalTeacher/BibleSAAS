        <b>Bildad shows that man cannot be justified before God.</b>
      </p>
      <p id="xix.xxv-p2">—Bildad drops the question concerning the prosperity of wicked men; but shows the infinite distance there is between God and man. He represents to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxv-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.89.html#Ps.89.6">Ps 89:6</a>. As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be
	 bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, <a class="scripRef" id="xix.xxv-p2.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Zech.13.html#Zech.13.1">Zec 13:1</a>. We should be humbled as mean, guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by every sinner he redeems.</p>
