        <b>The building of the temple.</b>
      </p>
      <p id="xv.ii-p2">—There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in <a class="scripRef" id="xv.ii-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iKgs.6.html">1Ki 6</a>. It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily,
	 beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.</p>
