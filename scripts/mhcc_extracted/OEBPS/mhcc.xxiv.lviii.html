      <h2 id="xxiv.lviii-p0.2">Chapter 58</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p1">  Hypocrisy reproved. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.1">Is. 58:1,2</a>) A counterfeit and a true fast, with promises to real godliness, and, (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.3">Is. 58:3-12</a>) to the keeping the sabbath. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.13">Is. 58:13,14</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.1">Is. 58:1,2</a></b>  The Holy Spirit had hypocrites of every age in view. Self-love and timid Christians may say, Spare thyself; dislike to the cross and other motives will say, "Spare the rich and powerful;" but God says, "Spare not:" and we must obey God, not men. We all need earnestly to pray for God's assistance in examining ourselves. Men may go far toward heaven, yet come short; and they may go to hell with a good reputation.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.3">Is. 58:3-12</a></b>  A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not express true sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, it is not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated or occasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignant passions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God than mere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many who seem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass their families. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love. Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, show repentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, from right motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sin and oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones and weaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness and charity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justly and love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good works will bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to God and man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.</p>

      <p id="xxiv.lviii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.58.html#Isa.58.13">Is. 58:13,14</a></b>  The sabbath is a sign between God and his professing people; his appointing it is a sign of his favour to them; and their observing it is a sign of their obedience to him. We must turn from travelling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament times the sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.lviii-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.1.html#Rev.1.10">Rev. 1:10</a>. If we thus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.</p>
