  <p id="ii.xxxii-p9">The angels of God appeared to Jacob, to encourage him with the assurance of the Divine protection. When God designs his people for great trials, he prepares them by great comforts. While Jacob, to whom the promise belonged, had been in hard service, Esau was become a prince. Jacob sent a message, showing that he did not insist upon the birth-right. Yielding pacifies great offences, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eccl.10.html#Eccl.10.4">Ec 10:4</a>. We must not refuse to speak respectfully, even to those
	 unjustly angry with us. Jacob received an account of Esau's warlike preparations against him, and was greatly afraid. A lively sense of danger, and quickening fear arising from it, may be found united with humble confidence in God's power and promise.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Gen.32.9-Gen.32.23">

  <p id="ii.xxxii-p10">Times of fear should be times of prayer: whatever causes fear, should drive us to our knees, to our God. Jacob had lately seen his guards of angels, but in this distress he applied to God, not to them; he knew they were his fellow-servants, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxii-p10.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rev.22.html#Rev.22.9">Re 22:9</a>. There cannot be a better pattern for true prayer than this. Here is a thankful acknowledgement of former undeserved favours; a humble confession of unworthiness; a plain statement of his fears and
	 distress; a full reference of the whole affair to the Lord, and resting all his hopes on him. The best we can say to God in prayer, is what he has said to us. Thus he made the name of the Lord his strong tower, and could not but be safe. Jacob's fear did not make him sink into despair, nor did his prayer make him presume upon God's mercy, without the use of means. God answers prayers by teaching us to order our affairs aright. To pacify Esau, Jacob sent him a present. We must not despair of
	 reconciling ourselves to those most angry against us.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Gen.32.24-Gen.32.32"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="ii.xxxii-p10.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxii-p10.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Gen.32.html#Gen.32.24">24–32</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="ii.xxxii-p11">A great while before day, Jacob being alone, more fully spread his fears before God in prayer. While thus employed, One in the likeness of a man wrestled with him. When the spirit helpeth our infirmities, and our earnest and vast desires can scarcely find words to utter them, and we still mean more than we can express, then prayer is indeed wrestling with God. However tried or discouraged, we shall prevail; and prevailing with Him in prayer, we shall prevail against all enemies that
	 strive with us. Nothing requires more vigour and unceasing exertion than wrestling. It is an emblem of the true spirit of faith and prayer. Jacob kept his ground; though the struggle continued long, this did not shake his faith, nor silence his prayer. He will have a blessing, and had rather have all his bone put out of joint than go away without one. Those who would have the blessing of Christ, must resolve to take no denial. The fervent prayer is the effectual prayer. The Angel puts a lasting
	 mark of honour upon him, by changing his name. Jacob signifies a supplanter. From henceforth he shall be celebrated, not for craft and artful management, but for true valour. Thou shalt be called Israel, a prince with God, a name greater than those of the great men of the earth. He is a prince indeed that is a prince with God; those are truly honourable that are mighty in prayer. Having power with God, he shall have power with men too; he shall prevail, and gain Esau's favour. Jacob gives a new
	 name to the place. He calls it Peniel, the face of God, because there he had seen the appearance of God, and obtained the favour of God. It becomes those whom God honours, to admire his grace towards them. The Angel who wrestled with Jacob was the second Person in the sacred Trinity, who was afterwards God manifest in the flesh, and who, dwelling in human nature, is called Immanuel, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.12.html#Hos.12.4">Ho 12:4</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="ii.xxxii-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Hos.12.html#Hos.12.5">5</a>. Jacob halted on his
	 thigh. It might serve to keep him from being lifted up with the abundance of the revelations. The sun rose on Jacob: it is sun-rise with that soul, which has had communion with God.</p>
