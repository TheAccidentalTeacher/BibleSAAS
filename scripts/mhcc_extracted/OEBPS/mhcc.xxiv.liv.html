      <h2 id="xxiv.liv-p0.2">Chapter 54</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.liv-p1">  The increase of the church by the conversion of the Jews and Gentiles. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.1">Is. 54:1-5</a>) Its certain deliverance. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.6">Is. 54:6-10</a>) Its triumphant state is described. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.11">Is. 54:11-17</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxiv.liv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.1">Is. 54:1-5</a></b>  Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a long time before Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel, multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. This is matter of great rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church were extended. Though its state on earth is but mean and movable, like a tent or tabernacle, it is sometimes a growing state, and must be enlarged as the family increases. But the more numerous the church grows, the more she must fortify herself against errors and corruptions. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, the Mediator of the covenant made with the Old Testament church. Long he had been called the God of Israel; but now he shall be called the God of the whole earth. And he will cleanse from sin, and cause every true believer to rejoice in this sacred union. We never can enough admire this mercy, or duly value this privilege.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.liv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.liv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.6">Is. 54:6-10</a></b>  As God is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. And how sweet the returns of mercy would be, when God should come and comfort them! He will have mercy on them. God's gathering his people takes rise from his mercy, not any merit of theirs; and it is with great mercies, with everlasting kindness. The wrath is little, the mercies great; the wrath for a moment, the kindness everlasting. We are neither to despond under afflictions, nor to despair of relief. Mountains have been shaken and removed, but the promises of God never were broken by any event. Mountains and hills also signify great men. Creature-confidences shall fail; but when our friends fail us, our God does not. All this is alike applicable to the church at large, and to each believer. God will rebuke and correct his people for sins; but he will not cast them off. Let this encourage us to give the more diligence to make our calling and election sure.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.liv-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.liv-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.54.html#Isa.54.11">Is. 54:11-17</a></b>  Let the people of God, when afflicted and tossed, think they hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking notice of their griefs and fears. The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, "Wasters made to destroy," for they make wasting and destruction their business. He created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.liv-p7.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jude.1.html#Jude.1.1">Jude 1</a>:15. Security and final victory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.</p>
