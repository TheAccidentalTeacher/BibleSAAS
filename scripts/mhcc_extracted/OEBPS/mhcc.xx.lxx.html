      <p id="xx.lxx-p1">
        <b>The speedy destruction of the wicked, and the preservation of the godly.</b>
      </p>
      <p id="xx.lxx-p2">—This psalm is almost the same as the last five verses of <a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxx-p2.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.40.html">Ps 40</a>. While here we behold Jesus Christ set forth in poverty and distress, we also see him denouncing just and fearful punishment on his Jewish, heathen, and antichristian enemies; and pleading for the joy and happiness of his friends, to his Father's honour. Let us apply these things to our own troubled circumstances, and in a believing manner bring them, and the sinful causes thereof,
	 to our remembrance. Urgent trials should always awake fervent prayers.</p>
