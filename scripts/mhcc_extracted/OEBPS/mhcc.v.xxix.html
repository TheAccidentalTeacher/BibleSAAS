  <p id="v.xxix-p7">There were more sacred solemnities in the seventh month than in any other. It was the space between harvest and seed-time. The more leisure we have from the pressing occupations of this life, the more time we should spend in the immediate service of God. The blowing of the trumpets was appointed, <a class="scripRef" id="v.xxix-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lev.22.html#Lev.22.24">Le 22:24</a>. Here they are directed what sacrifices to offer on that day. Those who would know the mind of God in the Scriptures, must compare one part
	 with another. The latter discoveries of Divine light explain what was dark, and supply what was wanting, in the former, that the man of God may be perfect.</p>

  <h3 class="s02" id="v.xxix-p7.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="v.xxix-p7.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Num.29.html#Num.29.12">12–40</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="v.xxix-p8">Soon after the day of atonement, the day in which men were to afflict their souls, followed the feast of Tabernacles, in which they were to rejoice before the Lord. Their days of rejoicing were to be days of sacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful does us good, when it encourages our hearts in the duties of God's service. All the days of dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices; while we are here in a tabernacle state, it is our interest, as well as our duty, constantly to keep
	 up communion with God. The sacrifices for each of the seven days are appointed. Every day there must be a sin-offering, as in the other feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of God, unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice which Christ offered, when he made himself a Sin-offering for us. And no extraordinary services should put aside stated devotions. Every thing here reminds us of our sinfulness. The life that we live in the flesh must be by the faith of the Son of
	 God; until we go to be with him, to behold his glory, and praise his mercy, who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. To whom be honour and glory for ever. Amen.</p>
