  <p id="ix.iii-p9">The married state should be a rest, as much as any thing upon earth can be so, as it ought to fix the affections and form a connexion for life. Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnest prayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to his precepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in this important concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Be it always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our
	 souls. The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according to the laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne the appearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and custom gave Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claim upon Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, <a class="scripRef" id="ix.iii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Deut.25.html#Deut.25.5">De 25:5–10</a>. But this is not recorded for imitation in other times, and is not to be judged by modern rules.
	 And if there had been any evil in it, Ruth was a woman of too much virtue and too much sense to have listened to it.</p>

  <p id="ix.iii-p10">What in one age or nation would be improper, is not always so in another age or another nation. Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect
	 her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.</p>

  <p id="ix.iii-p11">Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently wait the event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still, <a class="scripRef" id="ix.iii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.30.html#Isa.30.7">Isa 30:7</a>. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the
	 right to redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? <a class="scripRef" id="ix.iii-p11.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Acts.9.html#Acts.9.6">Ac 9:6</a>. He will never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well with them also.</p>
