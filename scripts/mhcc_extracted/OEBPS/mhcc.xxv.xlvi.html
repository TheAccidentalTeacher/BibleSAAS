      <p id="xxv.xlvi-p1">  The defeat of the Egyptians. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlvi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.46.html#Jer.46.1">Jer. 46:1-12</a>) Their overthrow after the siege of Tyre. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlvi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.46.html#Jer.46.13">Jer. 46:13-26</a>) A promise of comfort to the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlvi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.46.html#Jer.46.27">Jer. 46:27,28</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.xlvi-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xlvi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlvi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.46.html#Jer.46.1">Jer. 46:1-12</a></b>  The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him. The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.</p>
      <p id="xxv.xlvi-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.xlvi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.xlvi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.46.html#Jer.46.13">Jer. 46:13-28</a></b>  Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on. Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed to the yoke of subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: the Chaldeans shall come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel of God, designed to encourage them when the judgments of God were abroad among the nations. He will be with them, and only correct them in measure; and will not punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence.</p>
