      <h2 id="xxvi.iii-p0.2">Chapter 3</h2>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p1">  The faithful lament their calamities, and hope in God's mercies.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.iii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.3.html#Lam.3.1">Lam. 3:1-20</a></b>  The prophet relates the more gloomy and discouraging part of his experience, and how he found support and relief. In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. But the weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hope are perished from the Lord.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.iii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.3.html#Lam.3.21">Lam. 3:21-36</a></b>  Having stated his distress and temptation, the prophet shows how he was raised above it. Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.iii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.3.html#Lam.3.37">Lam. 3:37-41</a></b>  While there is life there is hope; and instead of complaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with the hope they will be better. We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers. If inward impressions do not answer to outward expressions, we mock God, and deceive ourselves.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p8"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.iii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.3.html#Lam.3.42">Lam. 3:42-54</a></b>  The more the prophet looked on the desolations, the more he was grieved. Here is one word of comfort. While they continued weeping, they continued waiting; and neither did nor would expect relief and succour from any but the Lord.</p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p10"> </p>
      <p id="xxvi.iii-p11"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvi.iii-p11.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Lam.3.html#Lam.3.55">Lam. 3:55-66</a></b>  Faith comes off conqueror, for in these verses the prophet concludes with some comfort. Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution. He will save believers with everlasting salvation, while his enemies perish with everlasting destruction.</p>
