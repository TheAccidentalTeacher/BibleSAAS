  <p id="v.xiii-p9">A memorable and melancholy history is related in this and the following chapter, of the turning back of Israel from the borders of Canaan, and the sentencing them to wander and perish in the wilderness, for their unbelief and murmuring. It appears, <a class="scripRef" id="v.xiii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Deut.1.html#Deut.1.22">De 1:22</a>, that the motion to search out the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of their own policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believing the reports and
	 representations of sense rather than Divine revelation. We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be of good courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good management and resolution; but a great trust was reposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Courage in such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Num.13.21-Num.13.25"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="v.xiii-p9.3"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="v.xiii-p9.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Num.13.html#Num.13.21">21–25</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="v.xiii-p10">The searchers of the land brought a bunch of grapes with them, and other fruits, as proofs of the goodness of the country; which was to Israel both the earnest and the specimen of all the fruits of Canaan. Such are the present comforts we have in communion with God, foretastes of the fulness of joy we expect in the heavenly Canaan. We may see by them what heaven is.</p>

  <h3 class="s02" id="v.xiii-p10.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="v.xiii-p10.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Num.13.html#Num.13.26">26–33</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="v.xiii-p11">We may wonder that the people of Israel staid forty days for the return of their spies, when they were ready to enter Canaan, under all the assurances of success they could have from the Divine power, and the miracles that had hitherto attended them. But they distrusted God's power and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief! At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged the people from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left
	 to this temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land as good as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engaged it to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb, however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only. He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go and possess
	 it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle and vanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God. All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes; but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbelief overlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger and difficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord help us to believe! we shall then find all things possible.</p>
