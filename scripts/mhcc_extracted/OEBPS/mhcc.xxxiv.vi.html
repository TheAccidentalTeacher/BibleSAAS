  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p15">Christ justifies his disciples in a work of necessity for themselves on the sabbath day, and that was plucking the ears of corn when they were hungry. But we must take heed that we mistake not this liberty for leave to commit sin. Christ will have us to know and remember that it is his day, therefore to be spent in his service, and to his honour.</p>

  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p16">Christ was neither ashamed nor afraid to own the purposes of his grace. He healed the poor man, though he knew that his enemies would take advantage against him for it. Let us not be drawn either from our duty or from our usefulness by any opposition. We may well be amazed, that the sons of men should be so wicked.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxiv.vi-p16.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Luke.6.12-Luke.6.19"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxiv.vi-p16.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.vi-p16.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.6.html#Luke.6.12">12–19</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p17">We often think one half hour a great deal to spend in meditation and secret prayer, but Christ was whole nights engaged in these duties. In serving God, our great care should be not to lose time, but to make the end of one good duty the beginning of another. The twelve apostles are here named; never were men so privileged, yet one of them had a devil, and proved a traitor. Those who have not faithful preaching near them, had better travel far than be without it. It is indeed worth
	 while to go a great way to hear the word of Christ, and to go out of the way of other business for it. They came to be cured by him, and he healed them. There is a fulness of grace in Christ, and healing virtue in him, ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for each. Men regard the diseases of the body as greater evils than those of their souls; but the Scripture teaches us differently.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxiv.vi-p17.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Luke.6.20-Luke.6.26">

  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p18">Here begins a discourse of Christ, most of which is also found in <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.vi-p18.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.5.html">Mt 5</a>; <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.vi-p18.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.7.html">7</a>. But some think that this was preached at another time and place. All believers that take the precepts of the gospel to themselves, and live by them, may take the promises of the gospel to themselves, and live upon them. Woes are denounced against prosperous sinners as miserable people, though the world envies them. Those are blessed indeed
	 whom Christ blesses, but those must be dreadfully miserable who fall under his woe and curse! What a vast advantage will the saint have over the sinner in the other world! and what a wide difference will there be in their rewards, how much soever the sinner may prosper, and the saint be afflicted here!</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxiv.vi-p18.3"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Luke.6.27-Luke.6.36"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxiv.vi-p18.4"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.vi-p18.5" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.6.html#Luke.6.27">27–36</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p19">These are hard lessons to flesh and blood. But if we are thoroughly grounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commands easy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, and knows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say, in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Let us then aim to be merciful, even according to the mercy of our heavenly Father to us.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxiv.vi-p19.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Luke.6.37-Luke.6.49"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxiv.vi-p19.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxiv.vi-p19.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.6.html#Luke.6.37">37–49</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxiv.vi-p20">All these sayings Christ often used; it was easy to apply them. We ought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowance ourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shall ourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made in another world, not in this world, yet Providence does what should encourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil, follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known by its
	 fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that we may be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouth commonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the course that will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act according to the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found their hope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can no man lay. In
	 death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the power of Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.</p>
