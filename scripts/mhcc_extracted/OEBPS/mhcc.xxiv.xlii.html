      <h2 id="xxiv.xlii-p0.2">Chapter 42</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p1">  The character and coming of Christ. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.1">Is. 42:1-4</a>) The blessings of his kingdom. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.5">Is. 42:5-12</a>) The prevalence of true religion. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.13">Is. 42:13-17</a>) Unbelief and blindness reproved. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.18">Is. 42:18-25</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.1">Is. 42:1-4</a></b>  This prophecy was fulfilled in Christ, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Matt.12.html#Matt.12.17">Matt. 12:17</a>. Let our souls rely on him, and rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Father will be well-pleased with us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but rested upon him, and without measure. He patiently bore the contradiction of sinners. His kingdom is spiritual; he was not to appear with earthly honours. He is tender of those oppressed with doubts and fears, as a bruised reed; those who are as smoking flax, as the wick of a lamp newly lighted, which is ready to go out again. He will not despise them, nor lay upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear. By a long course of miracles and his resurrection, he fully showed the truth of his holy religion. By the power of his gospel and grace he fixes principles in the minds of men, which tend to make them wise and just. The most distant nations wait for his law, wait for his gospel, and shall welcome it. If we would make our calling and election sure, and have the Father delight over us for good, we must behold, hear, believe in, and obey Christ.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.5">Is. 42:5-12</a></b>  The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.13">Is. 42:13-17</a></b>  The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry, in the preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes, which must be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleeping world. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those that contradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame; and that which hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. To those who by nature were blind, God will show the way to life and happiness by Jesus Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will make darkness light. They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain. Those whom God brings into the right way, he will guide in it. This passage is a prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; for the Lord will never leave nor forsake them.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p8"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.xlii-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.xlii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.42.html#Isa.42.18">Is. 42:18-25</a></b>  Observe the call given to this people, and the character given of them. Multitudes are ruined for want of observing that which they cannot but see; they perish, not through ignorance, but carelessness. The Lord is well-pleased in the making known his own righteousness. For their sins they were spoiled of all their possessions. This fully came to pass in the destruction of the Jewish nation. There is no resisting, nor escaping God's anger. See the mischief sin makes; it provokes God to anger. And those not humbled by lesser judgments, must expect greater. Alas! how many professed Christians are blind as the benighted heathen! While the Lord is well-pleased in saving sinners through the righteousness of Christ he will also glorify his justice, by punishing all proud despisers. Seeing God has poured out his wrath on his once-favoured people, because of their sins, let us fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should be found to come short of it.</p>
