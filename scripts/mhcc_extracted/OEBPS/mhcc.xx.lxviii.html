  <p id="xx.lxviii-p15">None ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. God is the joy of his people, then let them rejoice when they come before him. He who derives his being from none, but gives being to all, is engaged by promise and covenant to bless his people. He is to be praised as a God of mercy and tender compassion. He ever careth for the afflicted and oppressed: repenting sinners, who are helpless and exposed more than any fatherless children, are admitted into his family, and share all
	 their blessings.</p>

  <p id="xx.lxviii-p16">Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as
	 showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the
	 wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.</p>

  <p id="xx.lxviii-p17">The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied, <a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxviii-p17.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eph.4.html#Eph.4.8">Eph 4:8</a>. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him,
	 <a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxviii-p17.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.17.html#John.17.2">Joh 17:2</a>. Christ came to a rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation.
	 The Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.</p>

  <p id="xx.lxviii-p18">The victories with which God blessed David over the enemies of Israel, are types of Christ's victory, for himself and for all believers. Those who take him for theirs, may see him acting as their God, as their King, for their good, and in answer to their prayers; especially in and by his word and ordinances. The kingdom of the Messiah shall be submitted to by all the rulers and learned in the world. The people seem to address the king, ver. #(<a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxviii-p18.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.68.html#Ps.68.28">28</a>). But the words are applicable to the Redeemer, to his church, and every true believer. We pray, that thou, O God the Son, wilt complete thine undertaking for us, by finishing thy good work in us.</p>

  <p id="xx.lxviii-p19">A powerful invitation is given to those that are without, to join the church. Some shall submit from fear; overcome by their consciences, and the checks of Providence, they are brought to make peace with the church. Others will submit willingly, ver. #(<a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxviii-p19.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.68.html#Ps.68.29">29</a>, <a class="scripRef" id="xx.lxviii-p19.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.68.html#Ps.68.31">31</a>). There is that beauty and benefit in the service of God, and in the gospel of Christ which went forth from Jerusalem, which is enough to invite
	 sinners out of all nations.</p>

      <a id="xx.lxviii-p19.3"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_Ps.68.32-Ps.68.35">

  <p id="xx.lxviii-p20">God is to be admired and adored with reverence and godly fear, by all that attend in his holy places. The God of Israel gives strength and power unto his people. Through Christ strengthening us we can do all things, not otherwise; therefore he must have the glory of all we do, with our humble thanks for enabling us to do it, and for accepting the work of his hands in us.</p>
