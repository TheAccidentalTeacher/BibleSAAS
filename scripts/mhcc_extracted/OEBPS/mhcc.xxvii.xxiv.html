      <p id="xxvii.xxiv-p1">  The fate of Jerusalem. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxiv-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.24.html#Ezek.24.1">Ezek. 24:1-14</a>) The extent of the sufferings of the Jews. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxiv-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.24.html#Ezek.24.15">Ezek. 24:15-27</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxiv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxiv-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxiv-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.24.html#Ezek.24.1">Ezek. 24:1-14</a></b>  The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by the Chaldeans: all orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as a prey for the enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions, as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the top of the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased. Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed for the punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will come surely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances and providences are all lost.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxiv-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xxiv-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxiv-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.24.html#Ezek.24.15">Ezek. 24:15-27</a></b>  Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must be kept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men that have no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions of those who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. God takes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed be God, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should all comforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and the mourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.</p>
