      <h1 id="iii-p0.1">Exodus</h1>
      <p id="iii-p1">The Book of Exodus relates the forming of the children of Israel into a church and a nation. We have hitherto seen true religion shown in domestic life, now, we begin to trace its effects upon the concerns of kingdoms and nations. Exodus signifies “the departure;” the chief event therein recorded is the departure of Israel from Egypt and Egyptian bondage; it plainly points out the fulfilling of several promises and prophecies to Abraham respecting his seed, and shadows forth the
  state of the church, in the wilderness of this world, until her arrival at the heavenly Canaan, an eternal rest.</p>
