  <p id="xxxviii.vii-p13">The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All must determine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought to
	 act.</p>

  <p id="xxxviii.vii-p14">Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christ allows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.vii-p14.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rom.12.html#Rom.12.18">Ro 12:18</a>, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour
	 and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.</p>

  <p id="xxxviii.vii-p15">The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state a man may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in
	 the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.</p>
  </div>
      <a id="xxxviii.vii-p15.1"/>
      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Cor.7.25-1Cor.7.35"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxviii.vii-p15.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.vii-p15.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.7.html#iCor.7.25">25–35</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxviii.vii-p16">Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best. Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world:
	 even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of
	 care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the
	 things of the Lord.</p>

      <div class="Commentary" id="Bible_1Cor.7.36-1Cor.7.40"> 
  <h3 class="s02" id="xxxviii.vii-p16.2"><b>Verses <a class="scripRef" id="xxxviii.vii-p16.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.iCor.7.html#iCor.7.36">36–40</a></b></h3> 

  <p id="xxxviii.vii-p17">The apostle is thought to give advice here about the disposal of children in marriage. In this view, the general meaning is plain. Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as to marriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and not reckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as they please, without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows. Second marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marry in the Lord.
	 In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, we should always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, and act in dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition ought only to be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds, that it will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.</p>
