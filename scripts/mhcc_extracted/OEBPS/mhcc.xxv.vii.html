      <h2 id="xxv.vii-p0.2">Chapter 7</h2>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p1">  Confidence in the temple is vain. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.1">Jer. 7:1-16</a>) The provocation by persisting in idolatry. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.17">Jer. 7:17-20</a>) God justifies his dealings with them. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.21">Jer. 7:21-28</a>) And threatens vengeance. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p1.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.29">Jer. 7:29-34</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.1">Jer. 7:1-16</a></b>  No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.</p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.17">Jer. 7:17-20</a></b>  The Jews took pride in showing zeal for their idols. Let us learn to be earnest in the service of our God, even from this bad example. Let us think it an honour to be employed in any work for God. Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. The direct tendency of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurt themselves. And they shall find there is no escaping. God's wrath is fire unquenchable.</p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.21">Jer. 7:21-28</a></b>  God shows that obedience was required of them. That which God commanded was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God. The promise is very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and his favour shall be your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience. We understand the gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, if we think that even the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation to obey.</p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p8"> </p>
      <p id="xxv.vii-p9"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxv.vii-p9.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Jer.7.html#Jer.7.29">Jer. 7:29-34</a></b>  In token both of sorrow and of slavery, Jerusalem must be degraded, and separated from God, as she had been separated to him. The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.</p>
