      <p id="xxvii.xxi-p1">  The ruin of Judah under the emblem of a sharp sword. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.1">Ezek. 21:1-17</a>) The approach of the king of Babylon described. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.18">Ezek. 21:18-27</a>) The destruction of the Ammonites. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.28">Ezek. 21:28-32</a>)</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxi-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.1">Ezek. 21:1-17</a></b>  Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxi-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.18">Ezek. 21:18-27</a></b>  By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresaw Nebuchadnezzar's march from Babylon, which he would determine by divination. The Lord would overturn the government of Judah, till the coming of Him whose right it is. This seems to foretell the overturnings of the Jewish nation to the present day, and the troubles of states and kingdoms, which shall make way for establishing the Messiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord secretly leads all to adopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the most tremendous warnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some mention of Him through whom mercy is shown to sinful men.</p>

      <p id="xxvii.xxi-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxvii.xxi-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ezek.21.html#Ezek.21.28">Ezek. 21:28-32</a></b>  The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies of victory. They would never recover their power, but in time would be wholly forgotten. Let us be thankful to be employed as instruments of mercy; let us use our understandings in doing good; and let us stand aloof from men who are only skilful to destroy.</p>
