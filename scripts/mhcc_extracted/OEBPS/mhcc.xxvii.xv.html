      <p id="xxvii.xv-p1">  Jerusalem like an unfruitful vine.</p>
      <p id="xxvii.xv-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxvii.xv-p3">  If a vine be fruitful, it is valuable. But if not fruitful, it is worthless and useless, it is cast into the fire. Thus man is capable of yielding a precious fruit, in living to God; this is the sole end of his existence; and if he fails in this, he is of no use but to be destroyed. What blindness then attaches to those who live in the total neglect of God and of true religion! This similitude is applied to Jerusalem. Let us beware of an unfruitful profession. Let us come to Christ, and seek to abide in him, and to have his words abide in us.</p>
