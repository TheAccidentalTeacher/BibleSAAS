      <h2 id="xxiv.iii-p0.2">Chapter 3</h2>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p1">  The calamities about to come upon the land. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.1">Is. 3:1-9</a>) The wickedness of the people. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.10">Is. 3:10-15</a>) The distress of the proud, luxurious women of Zion. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p1.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.16">Is. 3:16-26</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.1">Is. 3:1-9</a></b>  God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken away, <a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.6.html#John.6.27">John 6:27</a>. Here note, 1. That the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it on themselves.</p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.10">Is. 3:10-15</a></b>  The rule was certain; however there might be national prosperity or trouble, it would be well with the righteous and ill with the wicked. Blessed be God, there is abundant encouragement to the righteous to trust in him, and for sinners to repent and return to him. It was time for the Lord to show his might. He will call men to a strict account for all the wealth and power intrusted to and abused by them. If it is sinful to disregard the necessities of the poor, how odious and wicked a part do they act, who bring men into poverty, and then oppress them!</p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p6"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.iii-p7"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.iii-p7.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.3.html#Isa.3.16">Is. 3:16-26</a></b>  The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.</p>
