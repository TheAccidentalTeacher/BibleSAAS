      <p id="xxiv.ii-p1">  The conversion of the Gentiles, Description of the sinfulness of Israel. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.ii-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.2.html#Isa.2.1">Is. 2:1-9</a>) The awful punishment of unbelievers. (<a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.ii-p1.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.2.html#Isa.2.10">Is. 2:10-22</a>)</p>
      <p id="xxiv.ii-p2"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.ii-p3"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.ii-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.2.html#Isa.2.1">Is. 2:1-9</a></b>  The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, and that far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. Let Christians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is God who teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace, as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be no war; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place on the earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace. Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight in going up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompany them. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God; for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep. It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeases God, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, and happy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is a disgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands called Christian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they not full of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains and indulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten or despised?</p>
      <p id="xxiv.ii-p4"> </p>
      <p id="xxiv.ii-p5"><b><a class="scripRef" id="xxiv.ii-p5.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.2.html#Isa.2.10">Is. 2:10-22</a></b>  The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meant here, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts are led forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It is folly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hide or shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will be terrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth. Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of God convincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of God depriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of the Lord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence. Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shall be frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but the time will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This whole passage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready to leave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely on their heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease from depending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let not man be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in the Lord your God. Let us make this our great concern.</p>
